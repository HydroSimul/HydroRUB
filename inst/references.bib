  abstract = {We present a new data set of attributes for 671 catchments in the contiguous United States (CONUS) minimally impacted by human activities. This complements the daily time series of meteorological forcing and streamflow provided by Newman et al. (2015b). To produce this extension, we synthesized diverse and complementary data sets to describe six main classes of attributes at the catchment scale: topography, climate, streamflow, land cover, soil, and geology. The spatial variations among basins over the CONUS are discussed and compared using a series of maps. The large number of catchments, combined with the diversity of the attributes we extracted, makes this new data set well suited for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology. In comparison to the similar Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) data set, this data set relies on more recent data, it covers a wider range of attributes, and its catchments are more evenly distributed across the CONUS. This study also involves assessments of the limitations of the source data sets used to compute catchment attributes, as well as detailed descriptions of how the attributes were computed. The hydrometeorological time series provided by Newman et al. (2015b, https://doi.org/10.5065/D6MW2F4D) together with the catchment attributes introduced in this paper (https://doi.org/10.5065/D6G73C3Q) constitute the freely available CAMELS data set, which stands for Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies.},

  abstract = {Growing interest in global environmental issues has led to the need for global and regional assessment of water resources. A global water assessment model called ``WaterGAP 2'' is described, which consists of two main components'a Global Water Use model and a Global Hydrology model. These components are used to compute water use and availability on the river basin level. The Global Water Use model consists of (a) domestic and industry sectors which take into account the effect of structural and technological changes on water use, and (b) an agriculture sector which accounts especially for the effect of climate on irrigation water requirements. The Global Hydrology model calculates surface runoff and groundwater recharge based on the computation of daily water balances of the soil and canopy. A water balance is also performed for surface waters, and river flow is routed via a global flow routing scheme. The Global Hydrology model provides a testable method for taking into account the effects of climate and land cover on runoff. The components of the model have been calibrated and tested against data on water use and runoff from river basins throughout the world. Although its performance can and needs to be improved, the WaterGAP 2 model already provides a consistent method to fill in many of the existing gaps in water resources data in many parts of the world. It also provides a coherent approach for generating scenarios of changes in water resources. Hence, it is especially useful as a tool for globally comparing the water situation in river basins.},

  abstract = {Choosing (an) adequate model structure(s) for a given purpose, catchment, and data situation is a critical task in the modeling chain. However, despite model intercomparison studies, hypothesis testing approaches with modular modeling frameworks, and continuous efforts in model development and improvement, there are still no clear guidelines for identifying a preferred model structure. By introducing a framework for Automatic Model Structure Identification (AMSI), we support the process of identifying (a) suitable model structure(s) for a given task. The proposed AMSI framework employs a combination of the modular hydrological model RAVEN and the heuristic global optimization algorithm dynamically dimensioned search (DDS). It is the first demonstration of a mixed-integer optimization algorithm applied to simultaneously optimize model structure choices (integer decision variables) and parameter values (continuous decision variables) in hydrological modeling. The AMSI framework is thus able to sift through a vast number of model structure and parameter choices for identifying the most adequate model structure(s) for representing the rainfall-runoff behavior of a catchment. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by reidentifying given model structures that produced a specific hydrograph and show the limits of the current setup via a real-world application of AMSI on 12 MOPEX catchments. Results show that the AMSI framework is capable of inferring feasible model structure(s) reproducing the rainfall-runoff behavior of a given catchment. However, it is a complex optimization problem to identify model structure and parameters simultaneously. The variance in the identified structures is high due to near equivalent diagnostic measures for multiple model structures, reflecting substantial model equifinality. Future work with AMSI should consider the use of hydrologic signatures, case studies with multiple types of observation data, and the use of mixed-integer multiobjective optimization algorithms.},

Their capacity in modeling complex problems confirmed and motivated researchers to explore their merit in different disciplines. The use of two AI-models (probabilistic neural network and multilayer perceptron neural network) for the estimation of two different water quality indicators (namely dissolved oxygen (DO) and five days biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)) were reported in this study. The WQ parameters estimation based on four input modelling scenarios was adopted. Monthly water quality parameters data for the duration from January 2006 to December 2015 were used as the input data for the building of the prediction model. The proposed modelling was established utilizing many physical and chemical variables, such as turbidity, calcium (Ca), pH, temperature (T), total dissolved solids (TDS), Sulfate (SO4), total suspended solids (TSS), and alkalinity as the input variables. The proposed models were evaluated for performance using different statistical metrics and the evaluation results showed that the performance of the proposed models in terms of the estimation accuracy increases with the addition of more input variables in some cases. The performances of PNN model were superior to MLPNN model with estimation both DO and BOD parameters. The study concluded that the PNN model is a good tool for estimating the WQ parameters. The optimal evaluation indicators for PNN in predicting BOD are (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.231 and MAE = 0.197). The best performance indicators for PNN in predicting Do are (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.222 and MAE = 0.175).},

  abstract = {SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a conceptual, continuous time model that was developed in the early 1990s to assist water resource managers in assessing the impact of management and climate on water supplies and non-point source pollution in watersheds and large river basins. SWAT is the continuation of over 30 years of model development within the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service and was developed to `scale up' past field-scale models to large river basins. Model components include weather, hydrology, erosion/sedimentation, plant growth, nutrients, pesticides, agricultural management, stream routing and pond/reservoir routing. The latest version, SWAT2000, has several significant enhancements that include: bacteria transport routines; urban routines; Green and Ampt infiltration equation; improved weather generator; ability to read in daily solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed and potential ET; Muskingum channel routing; and modified dormancy calculations for tropical areas. A complete set of model documentation for equations and algorithms, a user manual describing model inputs and outputs, and an ArcView interface manual are now complete for SWAT2000. The model has been recoded into Fortran 90 with a complete data dictionary, dynamic allocation of arrays and modular subroutines. Current research is focusing on bacteria, riparian zones, pothole topography, forest growth, channel downcutting and widening, and input uncertainty analysis. The model SWAT is meanwhile used in many countries all over the world. Recent developments in European Environmental Policy, such as the adoption of the European Water Framework directive in December 2000, demand tools for integrative river basin management. The model SWAT is applicable for this purpose. It is a flexible model that can be used under a wide range of different environmental conditions, as this special issue will show. The papers compiled here are the result of the first International SWAT Conference held in August 2001 in Rauischholzhausen, Germany. More than 50 participants from 14 countries discussed their modelling experiences with the model development team from the USA. Nineteen selected papers with issues reaching from the newest developments, the evaluation of river basin management, interdisciplinary approaches for river basin management, the impact of land use change, methodical aspects and models derived from SWAT are published in this special issue.

  abstract = {Attribution in its general definition aims to quantify drivers of change in a system. According to IPCC Working Group II (WGII) a change in a natural, human or managed system is attributed to climate change by quantifying the difference between the observed state of the system and a counterfactual baseline that characterizes the system's behavior in the absence of climate change, where ``climate change refers to any long-term trend in climate, irrespective of its cause'' (IPCC, 2014). Impact attribution following this definition remains a challenge because the counterfactual baseline, which characterizes the system behavior in the hypothetical absence of climate change, cannot be observed. Process-based and empirical impact models can fill this gap as they allow us to simulate the counterfactual climate impact baseline. In those simulations, the models are forced by observed direct (human) drivers such as land use changes, changes in water or agricultural management but a counterfactual climate without long-term changes. We here present ATTRICI (ATTRIbuting Climate Impacts), an approach to construct the required counterfactual stationary climate data from observational (factual) climate data. Our method identifies the long-term shifts in the considered daily climate variables that are correlated to global mean temperature change assuming a smooth annual cycle of the associated scaling coefficients for each day of the year. The produced counterfactual climate datasets are used as forcing data within the impact attribution setup of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a). Our method preserves the internal variability of the observed data in the sense that factual and counterfactual data for a given day have the same rank in their respective statistical distributions. The associated impact model simulations allow for quantifying the contribution of climate change to observed long-term changes in impact indicators and for quantifying the contribution of the observed trend in climate to the magnitude of individual impact events. Attribution of climate impacts to anthropogenic forcing would need an additional step separating anthropogenic climate forcing from other sources of climate trends, which is not covered by our method.},

  abstract = {Water use for various sectors (e.g. irrigation, livestock, domestic, energy and manufacturing) is increasing due to a growing global population and economic development. Additionally, increases in frequency and severity of droughts, heatwaves and compound drought-heatwave events, also lead to responses in sectoral water use and a reduction in water availability, intensifying water scarcity. However, limited knowledge exists on the responses in sectoral water use during these hydroclimatic extremes. In this study we quantify the impacts of droughts, heatwaves and compound events on water use of irrigation, livestock, domestic, energy and manufacturing sectors at global, country and local scales. To achieve this, datasets of reported and downscaled sectoral water use (i.e. withdrawal and consumption) were evaluated during these hydroclimatic extremes and compared to normal (non-extreme) periods for 1990--2019. Our analysis shows that these hydroclimatic extremes affect water use patterns differently per sector and region. Reported data show that domestic and irrigation water use increases during heatwaves in Eastern Europe and central continental United States, while water use decreases for thermoelectric sector, particularly in Europe while it increases in north and Eastern Asia. Additionally, global water use response patterns reveal that irrigation and domestic sectors are mostly prioritized over livestock, thermoelectric and manufacturing. Reported local-scale data reveal that for most sectors and regions/locations, stronger water use responses are found for heatwaves and compound events compared to impacts during hydrological droughts. Our outcomes provide improved understanding of sectoral water use behaviour under hydroclimatic extremes. Nonetheless, given the future threats to water availability and the limited accessible information of water use, there is an urgency to collect more monitored-driven data of sectoral water use for improved assessments of water scarcity under these extremes. Consequently, this research reveals the necessity of more realistic water use models to better represent the sectoral responses to hydroclimatic extremes.},

Previous studies have demonstrated the applicability of LSTM-based models for rainfall--runoff modelling; however, LSTMs have not been tested on catchments in Great Britain (GB). Moreover, opportunities exist to use spatial and seasonal patterns in model performances to improve our understanding of hydrological processes and to examine the advantages and disadvantages of LSTM-based models for hydrological simulation. By training two LSTM architectures across a large sample of 669 catchments in GB, we demonstrate that the LSTM and the Entity Aware LSTM (EA LSTM) models simulate discharge with median Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) scores of 0.88 and 0.86 respectively. We find that the LSTM-based models outperform a suite of benchmark conceptual models, suggesting an opportunity to use additional data to refine conceptual models. In summary, the LSTM-based models show the largest performance improvements in the north-east of Scotland and in south-east of England. The south-east of England remained difficult to model, however, in part due to the inability of the LSTMs configured in this study to learn groundwater processes, human abstractions and complex percolation properties from the hydro-meteorological variables typically employed for hydrological modelling.},

  abstract = {A hydrological forecasting model is presented that attempts to combine the important distributed effects of channel network topology and dynamic contributing areas with the advantages of simple lumped parameter basin models. Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/contributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from the Crimple Beck basin are described. Using only measured and estimated parameter values, without optimization, the model makes satisfactory predictions of basin response. The modular form of the model structure should allow application over a range of small and medium sized basins while retaining the possibility of including more complex model components when suitable data are available.},

  abstract = {In recent years, geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) approach to estimate the runoff from a watershed due to different storm patterns has gained wide acceptability for watersheds with scanty data. In this study, a user-friendly event based computerized GIUH model, GIUH\_CAL, was developed. GIUH\_CAL model incorporates an infiltration component. Depending on the availability of soil and infiltration data, the model offers a choice among three methods of infiltration calculation, viz., Richards' equation, phi-index method and Philip two term model. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the model is based on mouse-driven approach with pop-up windows, pull-down menus, sub-menus, toolbar, statusbar and button controls including comprehensive context-sensitive help file. GIUH\_CAL model displays generated instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH), unit hydrograph (UH) and direct runoff hydrograph (DRH) of the watershed graphically and processes statistically. Modelling efficiency (ME), coefficient of residual mass (CRM), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (r2) are used as the performance criteria. The model was tested for two distinctly different watersheds, i.e., a 4th order Guptamani watershed in tropical sub-humid region and a 3rd order Upper Chhokeranala watershed in semi-arid region of India. The results show that model performs satisfactorily for both test watersheds and performance is much better with Richards' equation option of infiltration calculation as compared to phi-index method and Philip two term model.Thus, GIUH\_CAL model can be adopted as a standard tool for modelling rainfall--runoff transformation process in scantily gauged watersheds.},

  abstract = {An efficient time-dependent equation for predicting ground surface temperature devised by Bhumralkar (1975) and Blackadar (1976) is tested against a 12-layer soil model and compared with five other approximate methods in current use. It is found to be generally superior if diurnal forcing is present and very much superior to the use of the insulated surface assumption. An analogous method of predicting ground surface moisture content is presented which allows the surface to become moist quickly during rainfall or to become drier than the bulk soil while evaporation occurs. These improved methods are not of much relevance unless the main influences of a vegetation layer are included. An efficient one-layer foliage parameterization is therefore developed that extends continuously from the case of no shielding of the ground by vegetation to complete shielding. It includes influences of both ground and foliage albedos and emissivities, net leaf area index, stomatal resistance, retained water on the foliage, and several other considerations. When it is tested against data for wheat measured by Penman and Long (1960), it appears quite adequate despite the many simplifying assumptions. The parameterization predicts that errors of up to a factor of 2 in evapotranspiration can be incurred by ignoring the presence of a vegetation layer.},

  abstract = {An ability to describe hydrologically relevant differences between places is at the core of our science. A common way to characterize hydrological catchments is to use descriptors that summarize important physical aspects of the system, often by aggregating heterogeneous geospatial data into a single number. Such descriptors aim to capture various facets of catchment functioning and structure, identify similarity or dissimilarity, and transfer information among them. However, so far there is no agreement on how catchment descriptors should be selected, aggregated and evaluated. Even worse, little is known about the existence of potential biases in the current practices to characterize catchments. In this systematic review, we analyze 742 research articles published between 1967 and 2021 to provide a categorized overview of current and historical practices of catchment characterization (i.e., data sources, aggregation and evaluation methods) in hydrological science and related disciplines. We uncover the existence of substantial biases in catchment characterization: (1) only 16\% of the analyzed studies are in dry environments, even though such environments cover 42\% of global land surface; (2) only 30\% of studies use subsurface features for catchment characterization; (3) only 4\% and 9\% of descriptors are aggregated in spatially- and vertically-differentiated way respectively, while the absolute majority of descriptors are simple averages and do not account for hydrologically-relevant variabilities of features within catchments; (4) 25\% of analyzed studies do not evaluate the usefulness and none of the analyzed studies quantify the uncertainties of catchment descriptors. We demonstrate the potential effects of these biases on our ability to effectively characterize catchments and identify functional similarity of catchment behavior with illustrative examples. Finally, we suggest possible ways to derive more robust, comprehensive and hydrologically meaningful catchment descriptors.},

The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979--2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions.

  abstract = {Current changes in the world's climate increasingly impact a wide variety of sectors globally, from agriculture and ecosystems to water and energy supply or human health. Many impacts of climate on these sectors happen at high spatio-temporal resolutions that are not covered by current global climate datasets. Here we present CHELSA-W5E5 (https://doi.org/10.48364/ISIMIP.836809.3, Karger et al., 2022): a climate forcing dataset at daily temporal resolution and 30 arcsec spatial resolution for air temperatures, precipitation rates, and downwelling shortwave solar radiation. This dataset is a spatially downscaled version of the 0.5{$\circ$} W5E5 dataset using the CHELSA V2 topographic downscaling algorithm. We show that the downscaling generally increases the accuracy of climate data by decreasing the bias and increasing the correlation with measurements from meteorological stations. Bias reductions are largest in topographically complex terrain. Limitations arise for minimum near-surface air temperatures in regions that are prone to cold-air pooling or at the upper extreme end of surface downwelling shortwave radiation. We further show that our topographically downscaled climate data compare well with the results of dynamical downscaling using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, as time series from both sources are similarly well correlated to station observations. This is remarkable given the lower computational cost of the CHELSA V2 algorithm compared to WRF and similar models. Overall, we conclude that the downscaling can provide higher-resolution climate data with increased accuracy. Hence, the dataset will be of value for a wide range of climate change impact studies both at global level and for applications that cover more than one region and benefit from using a consistent dataset across these regions.},

  abstract = {The current generation of hydrological models has been widely criticized for their inability to adequately simulate hydrological processes. In this study, we evaluate competing model representations of hydrological processes with respect to their capability to simulate observed processes in the Mahurangi River basin in Northland, New Zealand. In the first part of this two-part series, the precipitation, soil moisture, and flow data in the Mahurangi were used to estimate the dominant hydrological processes and explore several options for their suitable mathematical representation. In this paper, diagnostic tests are applied to gain several insights for model selection. The analysis highlights dominant hydrological processes (e.g. the importance of vertical drainage and baseflow compared to sub-surface stormflow), provides guidance for the choice of modelling approaches (e.g. implicitly representing sub-grid heterogeneity in soils), and helps infer appropriate values for model parameters. The approach used in this paper demonstrates the benefits of flexible model structures in the context of hypothesis testing, in particular, supporting a more systematic exploration of current ambiguities in hydrological process representation. The challenge for the hydrological community is to make better use of the available data, not only to estimate parameter values but also to diagnostically identify more scientifically defensible model structures.

  abstract = {The problems of identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure remain outstanding research challenges for the discipline of hydrology. Progress on these problems requires understanding of the nature of differences between models. This paper presents a methodology to diagnose differences in hydrological model structures: the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE). FUSE was used to construct 79 unique model structures by combining components of 4 existing hydrological models. These new models were used to simulate streamflow in two of the basins used in the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX): the Guadalupe River (Texas) and the French Broad River (North Carolina). Results show that the new models produced simulations of streamflow that were at least as good as the simulations produced by the models that participated in the MOPEX experiment. Our initial application of the FUSE method for the Guadalupe River exposed relationships between model structure and model performance, suggesting that the choice of model structure is just as important as the choice of model parameters. However, further work is needed to evaluate model simulations using multiple criteria to diagnose the relative importance of model structural differences in various climate regimes and to assess the amount of independent information in each of the models. This work will be crucial to both identifying the most appropriate model structure for a given problem and quantifying the uncertainty in model structure. To facilitate research on these problems, the FORTRAN-90 source code for FUSE is available upon request from the lead author.},

Eleven physicochemical variables were analyzed from 95 open wells of the research area for two different seasons in 2020, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, respectively. Results revealed that the REGD-M5P model showed the best fit for all irrigation indices based on the correlation coefficient(r) for the SSP, MH, KR, and SAR index (0.947, 0.975, 0.950, and 0.956 during the training phase and 0.868, 0.966, 0.930, and 0.979 during the testing phase, respectively). Similarly, root mean square error (RMSE) values showed the best fit for the REGD-M5P model for all four irrigation indices, i.e., SSP, MH, KR, and SAR (3.696, 3.100, 0.115, and 0.393 in the training phase; 3.446, 3.772, 0.125 and 0.207 in the testing phase, respectively). It may be concluded that machine learning models may improve the parameters of irrigation water quality, and such findings are vital to farmers for crop selection and irrigation application planning. Additionally, the proposed machine learning models in predicting the irrigation water quality index and being fast decision tools for modeling irrigation water quality are also very important.},

Increasingly an alternative metric, the Kling--Gupta efficiency (KGE), is used instead. When NSE is used, NSE\&thinsp;=\&thinsp;0 corresponds to using the mean flow as a benchmark predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use KGE as a metric: negative KGE values are viewed as bad model performance, and only positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using the mean flow as a predictor does not result in KGE\&thinsp;=\&thinsp;0, but instead KGE\&thinsp;=1-{\textsurd}2{$\approx$}-0.41. Thus, KGE values greater than -0.41 indicate that a model improves upon the mean flow benchmark -- even if the model's KGE value is negative. NSE and KGE values cannot be directly compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on the coefficient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore, modellers who use the KGE metric should not let their understanding of NSE values guide them in interpreting KGE values and instead develop new understanding based on the constitutive parts of the KGE metric and the explicit use of benchmark values to compare KGE scores against. More generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of aggregated efficiency metrics and towards a framework based on purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more robust model adequacy assessment.},

Input data consisted of global radiation measures recorded at 215 stations, latitude, longitude, and elevation from a 30 arc-second Digital Elevation Model. The objective was to identify the most accurate prediction method for facilitating measurement of potential UV exposure at local (e.g.1km2 grid cell) and county levels. The ANUSPLIN method produced the smallest prediction errors in estimating values of potential UV exposure at 1 km2 resolution; these measurements were aggregated to the county level. We examined how much variation was lost through aggregation, as well as the potential bias associated with the possibility that some counties have predominantly north or south facing slopes. The impact of using inferior procedures on the estimates and geographic patterns of potential UV exposure was also examined. ANUSPLIN generated results that are reproducible and for which uncertainty is known. These measurements will be used in subsequent analysis of the role of UV exposure in melanoma etiology.},

  abstract = {Benchmarking the quality of river discharge data and understanding its information content for hydrological analyses is an important task for hydrologic science. There is a wide variety of techniques to assess discharge uncertainty. However, few studies have developed generalized approaches to quantify discharge uncertainty. This study presents a generalized framework for estimating discharge uncertainty at many gauging stations with different errors in the stage-discharge relationship. The methodology utilizes a nonparametric LOWESS regression within a novel framework that accounts for uncertainty in the stage-discharge measurements, scatter in the stage-discharge data and multisection rating curves. The framework was applied to 500 gauging stations in England and Wales and we evaluated the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at low, mean and high flow points on the rating curve. The framework was shown to be robust, versatile and able to capture place-specific uncertainties for a number of different examples. Our study revealed a wide range of discharge uncertainties (10--397\% discharge uncertainty interval widths), but the majority of the gauging stations (over 80\%) had mean and high flow uncertainty intervals of less than 40\%. We identified some regional differences in the stage-discharge relationships, however the results show that local conditions dominated in determining the magnitude of discharge uncertainty at a gauging station. This highlights the importance of estimating discharge uncertainty for each gauging station prior to using those data in hydrological analyses.},

  abstract = {Catchment-scale hydrological models are widely used to represent and improve our understanding of hydrological processes and to support operational water resource management. Conceptual models, which approximate catchment dynamics using relatively simple storage and routing elements, offer an attractive compromise in terms of predictive accuracy, computational demands, and amenability to interpretation. This paper introduces SuperflexPy, an open-source Python framework implementing the SUPERFLEX principles (Fenicia et al., 2011) for building conceptual hydrological models from generic components, with a high degree of control over all aspects of model specification. SuperflexPy can be used to build models of a wide range of spatial complexity, ranging from simple lumped models (e.g., a reservoir) to spatially distributed configurations (e.g., nested sub-catchments), with the ability to customize all individual model components. SuperflexPy is a Python package, enabling modelers to exploit the full potential of the framework without the need for separate software installations and making it easier to use and interface with existing Python code for model deployment. This paper presents the general architecture of SuperflexPy, discusses the software design and implementation choices, and illustrates its usage to build conceptual models of varying degrees of complexity. The illustration includes the usage of existing SuperflexPy model elements, as well as their extension to implement new functionality. Comprehensive documentation is available online and provided as a Supplement to this paper. SuperflexPy is available as open-source code and can be used by the hydrological community to investigate improved process representations for model comparison and for operational work.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The algorithm for and results of a newly developed multivariate non-parametric model, the Euclidean distance model (EDM), for the hourly disaggregation of daily climate data are presented here. The EDM is a resampling method based on the assumption that the day to be disaggregated has already occurred once in the past. The Euclidean distance (ED) serves as a measure of similarity to select the most similar day from historical records. EDM is designed to disaggregate daily means/sums of several climate elements at once, here temperature (               T               ), precipitation (               P               ), sunshine duration (               SD               ), relative humidity (               rH               ), and wind speed (               WS               ), while conserving physical consistency over all disaggregated elements. Since weather conditions and hence the diurnal cycles of climate elements depend on the weather pattern, a selection approach including objective weather patterns (OWP) was developed. The OWP serve as an additional criterion to filter the most similar day. For a case study, EDM was applied to the daily climate data of the stations Dresden and Fichtelberg (Saxony, Germany). The EDM results agree well with the observed data, maintaining their statistics. Hourly results fit better for climate elements with homogenous diurnal cycles, e.g.,               T               with very high correlations of up to 0.99. In contrast, the hourly results of the               SD               and the               WS               provide correlations up to 0.79. EDM tends to overestimate heavy precipitation rates, e.g., by up to 15\% for Dresden and 26\% for Fichtelberg, potentially due to, e.g., the smaller data pool for such events, and the equal-weighted impact of               P               in the               ED               calculation. The OWPs lead to somewhat improved results for all climate elements in terms of similar climate conditions of the basic stations. Finally, the performance of EDM is compared with the disaggregation tool               MELODIST               (F{\"o}rster et al. 2015). Both tools deliver comparable and well corresponding results. All analyses of the generated hourly data show that EDM is a very robust and flexible model that can be applied to any climate station. Since EDM can disaggregate daily data of climate projections, future research should address whether the model is capable to respect and (re)produce future climate trends. Further, possible improvements by including the flow direction and future               OWP               s should be investigated, also with regard to reduce the overestimation of heavy rainfall rates.},

  abstract = {A new global optimization algorithm, dynamically dimensioned search (DDS), is introduced for automatic calibration of watershed simulation models. DDS is designed for calibration problems with many parameters, requires no algorithm parameter tuning, and automatically scales the search to find good solutions within the maximum number of user-specified function (or model) evaluations. As a result, DDS is ideally suited for computationally expensive optimization problems such as distributed watershed model calibration. DDS performance is compared to the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm for multiple optimization test functions as well as real and synthetic SWAT2000 model automatic calibration formulations. Algorithms are compared for optimization problems ranging from 6 to 30 dimensions, and each problem is solved in 1000 to 10,000 total function evaluations per optimization trial. Results are presented so that future modelers can assess algorithm performance at a computational scale relevant to their modeling case study. In all four of the computationally expensive real SWAT2000 calibration formulations considered here (14, 14, 26, and 30 calibration parameters), results show DDS to be more efficient and effective than SCE. In two cases, DDS requires only 15--20\% of the number of model evaluations used by SCE in order to find equally good values of the objective function. Overall, the results also show that DDS rapidly converges to good calibration solutions and easily avoids poor local optima. The simplicity of the DDS algorithm allows for easy recoding and subsequent adoption into any watershed modeling application framework.},

This study proposed a deep-learning based model to estimate agricultural water withdrawal using hydro-meteorological variables, which projected the changes of agricultural water withdrawal influenced by climate change of future. The relationships between meteorological variables and stream water-use rate (WUR) were quantified using a deep belief network (DBN). The influences of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and monthly averaged WUR on the performance of the developed DBN model were tested. As a result, this DBN with potential evapotranspiration (PET) provided better performances than precipitation to estimate the WUR. The PET of multi-model scenarios for Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 would be increased as time goes by, and thus leads to increase WUR estimated by DBN in three basins, located in South Korea during the future period. On the contrary, water availability expected to decrease compared to the current. Therefore, managing water-uses and improving efficiencies can be prepared for the change in agricultural water-use by climate change in the future.},

In this study, the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES), a land surface scheme of the Met Office Unified Model (UM), is implemented to study the effect of different spatial resolutions on streamflow simulation at the Krishna River basin (catchment area 2,60,000~km2), India. The meteorological datasets used here are WFDEI (WATCH-Forcing-Data-ERA-Interim) global data at the resolution of 1{$^\circ$}\,{\texttimes}\,1{$^\circ$} and 2{$^\circ$}\,{\texttimes}\,2{$^\circ$}. The simulation is run for 2001--2008 period with 3~years (2001--2003) of spin-up with 50 spin-up cycle and further simulation of years from 2004--2008. To assess the performance of the stream flow simulation, appropriate statistical parameters such as mean error (ME), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), percentage BIAS (PBIAS) are used to see error statistics. The study results indicate that spatial resolution of routing, driving and ancillary data has a significant effect on model output at the river basin scale. Though we have implemented the simulations in coarser resolutions, such studies on hydrological fluxes with a change of spatial resolution are important to know associated uncertainties with driving data and routing data resolution selection, this, in turn, would also help researchers to make meaningful management decisions to deal with future water security issues.},

In our study, the CE-test is a specially designed model evaluation procedure, including a set of enhanced tests of model performance and robustness. The hypothesis verification is carried out with two models, ECOMAG and SWAP, which are applied for the Lena and Mackenzie River basins. The following three versions of every model are compared: (1) version A with a priori assigned parameters (without any calibration); (2) version B calibrated against streamflow observations at the basin outlets only, and (3) version C calibrated against streamflow observations at several gauges within the basins. We found that the B and C versions were successful in passing the CE-test, while the A versions failed the test. The C versions performed better than the B versions, especially at the monthly time scale. Then, all model versions were forced by global climate model (GCM) ensemble data to simulate flow projections for the twenty-first century and assess the projection uncertainty. Summarizing the results, we found that the differences in projections (in terms of mean annual changes in discharge and their uncertainties) between A version and two other versions were nearly three times larger than the differences between the B and C versions. Thus, the CE-test results together with the estimated differences in projections give us reason to conclude that the successful comprehensive evaluation of a model increases its confidence and suitability for impact assessment.},

  abstract = {Freshwater availability has been recognized as a global issue, and its consistent quantification not only in individual river basins but also at the global scale is required to support the sustainable use of water. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model WGHM, which is a submodel of the global water use and availability model WaterGAP 2, computes surface runoff, groundwater recharge and river discharge at a spatial resolution of 0.5{$^\circ$}. WGHM is based on the best global data sets currently available, and simulates the reduction of river discharge by human water consumption. In order to obtain a reliable estimate of water availability, it is tuned against observed discharge at 724 gauging stations, which represent 50\% of the global land area and 70\% of the actively discharging area. For 50\% of these stations, the tuning of one model parameter was sufficient to achieve that simulated and observed long-term average discharges agree within 1\%. For the rest, however, additional corrections had to be applied to the simulated runoff and discharge values. WGHM not only computes the long-term average water resources of a country or a drainage basin but also water availability indicators that take into account the interannual and seasonal variability of runoff and discharge. The reliability of the modeling results is assessed by comparing observed and simulated discharges at the tuning stations and at selected other stations. The comparison shows that WGHM is able to calculate reliable and meaningful indicators of water availability at a high spatial resolution. In particular, the 90\% reliable monthly discharge is simulated well. Therefore, WGHM is suited for application in global assessments related to water security, food security and freshwater ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The energy sharing used to heat water represents around 15\% in European houses. To improve energy efficiency, smart heating systems could benefit from accurate domestic hot water consumption forecasting in order to adapt their heating profile. However, forecasting the hot water consumption for a single accommodation can be difficult since the data are generally highly non smooth and present large variations from day to day. We propose to tackle this issue with three deep learning approaches, Recurrent Neural Networks, 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Head Attention to perform one day ahead prediction of hot water consumption for an individual residence. Moreover, similarly as in the transformer architecture, we experiment enriching the last two approaches with various forms of position encoding to include the order of the sequence in the data. The experimented models achieved satisfying performances in term of MSE on an individual residence dataset, showing that this approach is promising to conceive building energy management systems based on deep forecasting models.},

  abstract = {To enhance global water use assessment, the WaterGAP3 model was improved for back-calculating domestic, manufacturing and thermoelectric water uses until 1950 for 177 countries. Model simulations were carried-out on a national scale to estimate water withdrawals and consumption as well as cooling water required for industrial processes and electricity production. Additionally, the amount of treated and untreated wastewater as generated by the domestic and manufacturing sectors was modeled. In the view of data availability, model simulations are based on key socio-economic driving forces and thermal electricity production. Technological change rates were derived from statistical records in order to consider developments in water use efficiency, which turned out to have a crucial role in water use dynamics. Simulated domestic and industrial water uses increased from ca. 300km3 in 1950 to 1345km3 in 2010, 12\% of which were consumed and 88\% of which were discharged back into freshwater bodies. The amount of domestic and manufacturing wastewater increased considerably over the last decade, but only half of it was untreated. The downscaling of the untreated wastewater volume to river basin scale indicates a matter of concern in East and Southeast Asia, Northern Africa, and Eastern and Southern Europe. In order to reach the Millennium Development Goals, securing water supply and the reduction of untreated wastewater discharges should be amongst the priority actions to be undertaken. Population growth and increased prosperity have led to increasing water demands. However, societal and political transformation processes as well as policy regulations resulting in new water-saving technologies and improvements counteract this development by slowing down and even reducing global domestic and industrial water uses.},

  abstract = {The gap in resolution between existing global climate model output and that sought by decision-makers drives an ongoing need for climate downscaling. Here we test the extent to which developments in deep learning can out-perform existing statistical approaches for downscaling historical rainfall in the highly complex terrain setting of New Zealand. While deep learning removes the need for manual feature selection when extracting spatial-temporal information from predictor fields, several key considerations need to be addressed. These include: the chosen complexity of the network architecture, suitable loss functions tailored to the problem, as well as input data considerations of domain size and amount of training data required to provide adequate out-of-sample generalization. Sensitivity testing to these considerations reveals that a relatively simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with carefully selected loss functions can considerably outperform existing statistical downscaling models based on multiple linear regression with manual feature selection. When aggregated across the entire region, the fraction of explained variance on wet days increased from 0.35 to 0.52, the root-mean-squared error reduced by over 20\% and percentage biases for the 90th percentile of rainfall improved by over 25\%. Using interpretable machine learning methods, we demonstrate that the CNN has been capable of self-learning physically plausible relationships between the large-scale atmospheric environment and extreme localized rainfall events. The historical performance and physical interpretability documented here lends support for wider development and application of deep learning in climate downscaling.},

  abstract = {Global climate models (GCMs) are commonly downscaled to understand future local climate change. The high computational cost of regional climate models (RCMs) limits how many GCMs can be dynamically downscaled, restricting uncertainty assessment. While statistical downscaling is cheaper, its validity in a changing climate is unclear. We combine these approaches to build an emulator leveraging the merits of dynamical and statistical downscaling. A machine learning model is developed for each coarse grid cell to predict fine grid variables, using coarse-scale climate predictors with fine grid land characteristics. Two RCM emulators, one Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and one Multiple Linear Regression error-reduced with Random Forest (MLR-RF), are developed to downscale daily evapotranspiration from 12.5 km (coarse-scale) to 1.5 km (fine-scale). Out-of-sample tests for the MLP and MLR-RF achieve Kling-Gupta-Efficiency of 0.86 and 0.83, correlation of 0.89 and 0.86, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.78 and 0.75, with a relative bias of -6\% to 5\% and -5\% to 4\%, respectively. Using histogram match for spatial efficiency, both emulators achieve a median score of {$\sim$}0.77. This is generally better than a common statistical downscaling method in a range of metrics. Additionally, through ``spatial transitivity,'' we can downscale GCMs for new regions at negligible cost and only minor performance loss. The framework offers a cheap and quick way to downscale large ensembles of GCMs. This could enable high-resolution climate projections from a larger number of global models, enabling uncertainty quantification, and so better support for resilience and adaptation planning.},

The main approaches employed are Statistical DownScaling (SDS) and Dynamic DownScaling (DDS). The former SDS consists of Linear Methods (LM), Stochastic Weather Generators, and Artificial Intelligence DownScaling techniques (IADS). Being computationally less demanding and highly portable, most studies apply LM, and IADS approaches to develop the downscaling. However, it is needed to evaluate whether these approaches allow obtaining representative, in the development of rainfall frequency analysis (RFA), in the estimative of the total precipitation (TP) and the number of rainy days (RD) both water year and multiannual level, as well as identify whether any of these approaches provide better results for the last generation of GCM\&rsquo;s made available for CMIP 6. On this basis and considering only the models with a horizontal resolution of 100 km that participated in the SSP1-2.6 and/or SSP5-8.5 scenarios of CMIP6, the present study aim to evaluate the performance of Delta Method (DM), Quantile Mapping (QM) and Regression Trees (RT) to develop RFA, estimate the TP and RD, based on rainfall series obtained by DownScaling, respect to estimative developed with historical records. The results show that the application of DM, RT and QM does not guarantee a temporal correlation between the TP and RD estimated with DownScaling and historical series, likewise, it is observed that in the estimation of RFA, the application of RT generates better results than QM. Finally, it is evident that not applying any DownScaling technique and applying QM generates similar results.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Spatially distributed historical meteorological forcings (temperature and precipitation) are commonly incorporated into modeling efforts for long-term natural resources planning. For water management decisions, it is critical to understand the uncertainty associated with the different choices made in hydrologic impact assessments (choice of hydrologic model, choice of forcing dataset, calibration strategy, etc.). This paper evaluates differences among four commonly used historical meteorological datasets and their impacts on streamflow simulations produced using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The four meteorological datasets examined here have substantial differences, particularly in minimum and maximum temperatures in high-elevation regions such as the Rocky Mountains. The temperature differences among meteorological forcing datasets are generally larger than the differences between calibration and validation periods. Of the four meteorological forcing datasets considered, there are substantial differences in calibrated model parameters and simulations of the water balance. However, no single dataset is superior to the others with respect to VIC simulations of streamflow. Also, optimal calibration parameter values vary across case study watersheds and select meteorological datasets, suggesting that there is enough flexibility in the calibration parameters to compensate for the effects of using select meteorological datasets. Evaluation of runoff sensitivity to changes in climate indicates that the choice of meteorological dataset may be as important in characterizing changes in runoff as climate change, supporting consideration of multiple sources of uncertainty in long-term planning studies.},

The cattail lysimeter began operation in February 1993. The mixed marsh vegetation lysimeter began operation in January 1994, and the open water lysimeter with occasional algae cover began operation in December 1993. The mean measured ET rate was 3.6 mm, 3.5 mm, and 3.7 mm per day for the cattail, mixed marsh vegetation, and open water/algae system, respectively. High resolution weather data were continuously measured at the site. Six models were applied to estimate daily ET rates of the three systems. The Penman-Monteith equation best estimated ET of cattail and mixed marsh vegetation, and the Penman Combination equation was most suitable for the open water/algae system. Empirical equations based on solar radiation and maximum temperature produced estimates of daily ET from the three systems that are comparable to models that require many more parameters. In cases where limited data is available, the calibrated simple models can be used to estimate ET from wetlands in south Florida.},

Values given by this formula typically differ from measured values by about 0.3 mm day-1 for annual means, 0.5 mm day-1 for monthly means, 0.9 mm day-1 for a week and 1.7 mm day-1 for a day. The formula applies over a wide range of climates. Monthly mean values of the term (T - Td) can be obtained either from an empirical table or from the following empirical relationship, provided precipitation is at least 5 mm month-1 and (T - Td) is at least 4{$^\circ$}C:(T-Td)=0.0023h+0.37T+0.53R+0.35Rann-10.9{$^\circ$}C where R is the mean daily range of temperature and Rann is the difference between the mean temperatures of the hottest and coldest months. Thus the evaporation rate can be estimated simply from values for the elevation, latitude and daily maximum and minimum temperatures.},

A general framework is suggested. Data from a number of saturated land sites and open water sites in the absence of advection suggest a widely applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and latent heat fluxes. For drying land surfaces, we assume that the evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation multiplied by a factor. This factor is found to remain at unity while an amount of water, varying from one site to another, is evaporated. Following this a linear decrease sets in, reducing the evaporation rate to zero after a further 5 cm of evaporation, the same at several sites examined.},

The comparison was first made using the original constant values involved in each equation, and then using the recalibrated constant values. The results show that when the original constant values were used, larger biases existed for most of the equations for both stations. When recalibrated constant values were substituted for the original constant values, six of the seven equations improved for both stations. Using locally calibrated parameter values, all seven equations worked well for determining mean seasonal evaporation values. For monthly evaporation values, the modified Blaney--Criddle method produced least error for all months for both stations, followed by the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods. The Linacre, Kharrufa and Hamon methods showed a significant bias in September for both stations. With properly determined constant values, the modified Blaney--Criddle, the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods can be recommended for estimating evaporation in the study region, as far as temperature-based methods are concerned.

Numerous downscaled weather data sets exist, but little attempt has been made to evaluate them systematically. Here we address this shortcoming by focusing on four major questions: (1) How accurate are downscaled, gridded climate data sets in terms of temperature and precipitation estimates? (2) Are there significant regional differences in accuracy among data sets? (3) How accurate are their mean values compared with extremes? (4) Does their accuracy depend on spatial resolution? We compared eight widely used downscaled data sets that provide gridded daily weather data for recent decades across the United States. We found considerable differences among data sets and between downscaled and weather station data. Temperature is represented more accurately than precipitation, and climate averages are more accurate than weather extremes. The data set exhibiting the best agreement with station data varies among ecoregions. Surprisingly, the accuracy of the data sets does not depend on spatial resolution. Although some inherent differences among data sets and weather station data are to be expected, our findings highlight how much different interpolation methods affect downscaled weather data, even for local comparisons with nearby weather stations located inside a grid cell. More broadly, our results highlight the need for careful consideration among different available data sets in terms of which variables they describe best, where they perform best, and their resolution, when selecting a downscaled weather data set for a given ecological application.},

However, the spatial resolutions of IAMs and CMs differ. IAMs usually disaggregate the world into 10--30 aggregated regions, whereas CMs require a grid-based spatial resolution. Therefore, downscaling emissions data from IAMs into a finer scale is necessary to input the emissions into CMs. In this study, we examined whether differences in downscaling methods significantly affect climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. We tested two downscaling methods using the same regionally aggregated sulfur emissions scenario obtained from the Asian-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model. The downscaled emissions were fed into the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC). One of the methods assumed a strong convergence of national emissions intensity (e.g., emissions per gross domestic product), while the other was based on inertia (i.e., the base-year remained unchanged). The emissions intensities in the downscaled spatial emissions generated from the two methods markedly differed, whereas the emissions densities (emissions per area) were similar. We investigated whether the climate change projections of temperature and precipitation would significantly differ between the two methods by applying a field significance test, and found little evidence of a significant difference between the two methods. Moreover, there was no clear evidence of a difference between the climate simulations based on these two downscaling methods.},

These are: (i) the amount of time that the canopy spends saturated during rainfall and the evaporation rate applicable under these conditions; and (ii) the canopy saturation capacity and the number of times this store is emptied, by drying out after the cessation of rainfall. A model is then constructed which is conceptually similar to the Rutter model, but which replaces that model's numerical approach with an analysis by storm events. The evaporation from a saturated canopy during rainfall is estimated from the Penman-Monteith equation; the evaporation after rain has ceased, the effect of small storms insufficient to saturate the canopy, wetting-up the canopy and evaporation from the trunks are added as separate terms. The model has been tested against data from Thetford Forest in East Anglia, with satisfactory agreement between observation and estimation. It is suggested that the model may be capable of making useful estimates of the evaporation of intercepted rainfall, solely from rainfall measurements.},

  abstract = {Spatial interpolation of precipitation data is of great importance for hydrological modelling. Geostatistical methods (kriging) are widely applied in spatial interpolation from point measurement to continuous surfaces. The first step in kriging computation is the semi-variogram modelling which usually used only one variogram model for all-moment data. The objective of this paper was to develop different algorithms of spatial interpolation for daily rainfall on 1 km2 regular grids in the catchment area and to compare the results of geostatistical and deterministic approaches. This study leaned on 30-yr daily rainfall data of 70 raingages in the hilly landscape of the Ourthe and Ambleve catchments in Belgium (2908 km2). This area lies between 35 and 693 m in elevation and consists of river networks, which are tributaries of the Meuse River. For geostatistical algorithms, seven semi-variogram models (logarithmic, power, exponential, Gaussian, rational quadratic, spherical and penta-spherical) were fitted to daily sample semi-variogram on a daily basis. These seven variogram models were also adopted to avoid negative interpolated rainfall. The elevation, extracted from a digital elevation model, was incorporated into multivariate geostatistics. Seven validation raingages and cross validation were used to compare the interpolation performance of these algorithms applied to different densities of raingages. We found that between the seven variogram models used, the Gaussian model was the most frequently best fit. Using seven variogram models can avoid negative daily rainfall in ordinary kriging. The negative estimates of kriging were observed for convective more than stratiform rain. The performance of the different methods varied slightly according to the density of raingages, particularly between 8 and 70 raingages but it was much different for interpolation using 4 raingages. Spatial interpolation with the geostatistical and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) algorithms outperformed considerably the interpolation with the Thiessen polygon, commonly used in various hydrological models. Integrating elevation into Kriging with an External Drift (KED) and Ordinary Cokriging (OCK) did not improve the interpolation accuracy for daily rainfall. Ordinary Kriging (ORK) and IDW were considered to be the best methods, as they provided smallest RMSE value for nearly all cases. Care should be taken in applying UNK and KED when interpolating daily rainfall with very few neighbourhood sample points. These recommendations complement the results reported in the literature. ORK, UNK and KED using only spherical model offered a slightly better result whereas OCK using seven variogram models achieved better result.},

  abstract = {In recent years, geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) approach to estimate the runoff from a watershed due to different storm patterns has gained wide acceptability for watersheds with scanty data. In this study, a user-friendly event based computerized GIUH model, GIUH\_CAL, was developed. GIUH\_CAL model incorporates an infiltration component. Depending on the availability of soil and infiltration data, the model offers a choice among three methods of infiltration calculation, viz., Richards' equation, phi-index method and Philip two term model. The graphical user interface (GUI) of the model is based on mouse-driven approach with pop-up windows, pull-down menus, sub-menus, toolbar, statusbar and button controls including comprehensive context-sensitive help file. GIUH\_CAL model displays generated instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH), unit hydrograph (UH) and direct runoff hydrograph (DRH) of the watershed graphically and processes statistically. Modelling efficiency (ME), coefficient of residual mass (CRM), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (r2) are used as the performance criteria. The model was tested for two distinctly different watersheds, i.e., a 4th order Guptamani watershed in tropical sub-humid region and a 3rd order Upper Chhokeranala watershed in semi-arid region of India. The results show that model performs satisfactorily for both test watersheds and performance is much better with Richards' equation option of infiltration calculation as compared to phi-index method and Philip two term model.Thus, GIUH\_CAL model can be adopted as a standard tool for modelling rainfallerunoff transformation process in scantily gauged watersheds.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a method for the estimation of lag time of forested mountainous watersheds. Hydrological flood-flow design methods require a time parameter, such as lag time or time of concentration, to estimate peak discharge and the flood hydrograph shape. Most existing methods used to compute the time parameter of a watershed are empirical and have been developed for urban or rural watersheds. Use of these methods for forested mountainous watersheds may result in severe underestimation of watershed response time and consequently, in overestimation of peak flood discharge. The water flow in a watershed is separated and analysed in two phases, viz. the land or hillslope phase and the stream channel phase. Most of the flow in a forested steep watershed is generated through subsurface pathways, and this knowledge, acquired from field experiments, is combined with kinematic wave equations to describe the generation of flow from steep forested hillslopes. This hillslope runoff is then used as input to the stream channels. Kinematic wave equations are developed for the runoff movement in the channels by assuming that both the roughness coefficient and the stream channel slope vary with the distance from the outlet of the watershed. These assumptions are validated and confirmed with data from the USA and Coastal British Columbia, Canada. The resulting equations are integrated to obtain an equation for the lag time. Comparison of the results of the proposed equation with data from two experimental watersheds in Coastal British Columbia and empirical equations used for the calculation of the lag time indicates that the proposed method is reliable and gives a good approximation of the observed lag time. These results are compared with other empirical equation, and it is shown that these earlier methods can result in severe underestimation of lag time.},

No attempt has been made to eliminate the use or need of judgment and experience in such studies. The ``lag'' or time from center of mass of rainfall to peak of runoff is the principal drainage-basin characteristic used in deriving the synthetic unit-graphs. An approximate method of determining the ``lag'' is given for use on areas with no stage-records available. The peak-rate of the unit-graph is expressed as a function of the ``lag''.},

Currently most MWW data are reported as spatially aggregated over large-area survey regions or even lack of data, which is unable to meet the growing demand for spatially detailed data in many applications. In this paper, six different models are constructed and evaluated in estimating global MWW using aggregated MWW data and gridded raster covariates. Among the models, the artificial neural network-based indirect model (NNM) shows the best accuracy with higher R2 and lower NMAE and NRMSE in different spatial scales. The estimates achieved from the NNM model are consistent with census and survey data, and outperforms the existing global gridded MWW dataset. At last, the NNM model is applied to mapping global gridded MWW for the year 2015 at 0.1 {\^A} 0.1{$^\circ$} resolution. The proposed method can be applied to a wider aggregated output learning problem and the high-resolution global gridded MWW data can be used in hydrological models and water resources management.},

For the `model evaluation and impact attribution' part of the current round of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a), modelling teams generated historical simulations based on observed climate and direct human forcings with updated model versions. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of daily and maximum annual discharge based on ISIMIP3a simulations from nine GHMs by comparing the simulations to observational data from 644 river gauge stations. We also assess low flows and the effects of different river routing schemes. We find that models can reproduce variability in daily and maximum annual discharge, but tend to overestimate both quantities, as well as low flows. Models perform better at stations in wetter areas and at lower elevations. Discharge routed with the river routing model CaMa-Flood can improve the performance of some models, but for others, variability is overestimated, leading to reduced model performance. This study indicates that areas for future model development include improving the simulation of processes in arid regions and cold dynamics at high elevations. We further suggest that studies attributing observed changes in discharge to historical climate change using the current model ensemble will be most meaningful in humid areas, at low elevations, and in places with a regular seasonal discharge as these are the regions where the underlying dynamics seem to be best represented.},

In order to assess the future water and food situation, it is therefore necessary to model irrigation water requirements. We present a global model of irrigation requirements, which is based on a new raster map of irrigated areas. With a spatial resolution of 0.5{$^\circ$}, the model simulates the cropping patterns, the growing seasons, and the net and gross irrigation requirements, distinguishing two crops, rice and nonrice. Using long time series of monthly climatic variables, the irrigation requirements under present-day climate conditions are computed, and the impact of climate variability is analyzed. The correspondence between model results and independent estimates of irrigation water use is judged to be good enough for applying the model in global and continental studies.},

The toolbox provides accessible, standardised signature calculations, with clear information on methodological decisions and recommended parameter values. The toolbox implements three categories of signatures: basic signatures that describe the five components of a natural streamflow regime, signatures from benchmark papers, and an extended set of process-based signatures. The toolbox is designed for ease of use, including documentation, workflow scripts and example data to demonstrate implementation procedures, and visualisation options. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the signature calculations by applying reproducible workflows to large streamflow datasets.

The EDM is a resampling method based on the assumption that the day to be disaggregated has already occurred once in the past. The Euclidean distance (ED) serves as a measure of similarity to select the most similar day from historical records. EDM is designed to disaggregate daily means/sums of several climate elements at once, here temperature (               T               ), precipitation (               P               ), sunshine duration (               SD               ), relative humidity (               rH               ), and wind speed (               WS               ), while conserving physical consistency over all disaggregated elements. Since weather conditions and hence the diurnal cycles of climate elements depend on the weather pattern, a selection approach including objective weather patterns (OWP) was developed. The OWP serve as an additional criterion to filter the most similar day. For a case study, EDM was applied to the daily climate data of the stations Dresden and Fichtelberg (Saxony, Germany). The EDM results agree well with the observed data, maintaining their statistics. Hourly results fit better for climate elements with homogenous diurnal cycles, e.g.,               T               with very high correlations of up to 0.99. In contrast, the hourly results of the               SD               and the               WS               provide correlations up to 0.79.

All analyses of the generated hourly data show that EDM is a very robust and flexible model that can be applied to any climate station.

  abstract = {Hydrologists have been struggling over the past decades to improve rainfall-runoff models. As a consequence, models proposed 20 -- 30 years ago still keep evolving as progress is made in the understanding of catchment hydrological behaviour. Here we present the GR4J model, a daily lumped rainfall-runoff model which is the result of a continuous improvement process over the last 15 years. The article provides the mathematical formulation of a new four-parameter version of the model. Model performance is assessed on a large sample of catchments: compared to other rainfall-runoff models, the GR4J performance is among the best ones. It also gives better results than the previous three-parameter model version, especially in the simulation of low flows. The tests indicate that a four-parameter structure corresponds to the maximum level of complexity that could be afforded in the model. Adding more free parameters did not bring significant improvements. The gain in model robustness with this new version should enhance the confidence in the practical use of this simple model for water engineering and resource management. The discussion underlines the potential limits introduced in the modelling process when one relies on a priori concepts in building a model structure and it stresses the value of large catchment samples to assess models.},

The attraction of these models is their potential to provide information about the flow characteristics at points within catchments, but current representations in process-based models are often too crude to enable accurate, a priori application to predictive problems. The difficulties relate to both the perception of model capabilities and the fundamental assumptions and algorithms used in the models. In addition, the scale of measurement for many parameters is often not compatible with their use in hydrologic models. The most appropriate uses of process-based, distributed-parameter models are to assist in the analysis of data, to test hypotheses in conjunction with field studies, to improve our understanding of processes and their interactions and to identify areas of poor understanding in our process descriptions. The misperception that model complexity is positively correlated with confidence in the results is exacerbated by the lack of full and frank discussion of a model's capability /limitations and reticence to publish poor results. This may ultimately diminish the opportunity to advance understanding of natural processes because the managers of research resources are given the impression that the answers are already known and are being provided by models. Model development is often not carried out in conjunction with field programs designed to test complex models, so the link with reality is lost.},

This data set improves on previous products in its spatial resolution and extent, time period, number of contributing stations, and attention to finding the most appropriate method for spatial interpolation of daily climate observations. The gridded data are delivered on four spatial resolutions to match the grids used in previous products as well as many of the rotated pole Regional Climate Models (RCMs) currently in use. Each data set has been designed to provide the best estimate of grid box averages rather than point values to enable direct comparison with RCMs. We employ a three-step process of interpolation, by first interpolating the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperature using three-dimensional thin-plate splines, then interpolating the daily anomalies using indicator and universal kriging for precipitation and kriging with an external drift for temperature, then combining the monthly and daily estimates. Interpolation uncertainty is quantified by the provision of daily standard errors for every grid square. The daily uncertainty averaged across the entire region is shown to be largely dependent on the season and number of contributing observations. We examine the effect that interpolation has on the magnitude of the extremes in the observations by calculating areal reduction factors for daily maximum temperature and precipitation events with return periods up to 10 years.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31\,km, compared to 80\,km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10\,hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

Although the equifinality of hydrological modeling has been discussed for a long time, its influence on the hydrological analysis of climate change has not been studied enough to provide a definite idea about the relative contributions of uncertainty contained in both multiple general circulation models (GCMs) and multi-parameter ensembles to hydrological projections. This study demonstrated that the impact of multi-GCM ensemble uncertainty on direct runoff projections for headwater watersheds could be an order of magnitude larger than that of multi-parameter ensemble uncertainty. The finding suggests that the selection of appropriate GCMs should be much more emphasized than that of a parameter set among behavioral ones. When projecting soil moisture and groundwater, on the other hand, the hydrological modeling equifinality was more influential than the multi-GCM ensemble uncertainty. Overall, the uncertainty of GCM projections was dominant for relatively rapid hydrological components while the uncertainty of hydrological model parameterization was more significant for slow components. In addition, uncertainty in hydrological projections was much more closely associated with uncertainty in the ensemble projections of precipitation than temperature, indicating a need to pay closer attention to precipitation data for improved modeling reliability. Uncertainty in hydrological component ensemble projections showed unique responses to uncertainty in the precipitation and temperature ensembles.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations are widely used to support decision making and planning in the agriculture sector. On the one hand, many plant growth models use simplified hydrological processes and structures, e.g. by the use of a small number of soil layers or by the application of simple water flow approaches. On the other hand, in many hydrological models plant growth processes are poorly represented. Hence, fully coupled models with a high degree of process representation would allow a more detailed analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the soil-plant interface. We used the Python programming language to couple two of such high process oriented independent models and to calibrate both models simultaneously. The Catchment Modelling Framework (CMF) simulated soil hydrology based on the Richards equation and the van-Genuchten-Mualem retention curve. CMF was coupled with the Plant growth Modelling Framework (PMF), which predicts plant growth on the basis of radiation use efficiency, degree days, water shortage and dynamic root biomass allocation. The Monte Carlo based Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method was applied to parameterize the coupled model and to investigate the related uncertainty of model predictions to it. Overall, 19 model parameters (4 for CMF and 15 for PMF) were analysed through 2 {\texttimes} 106 model runs randomly drawn from an equally distributed parameter space. Three objective functions were used to evaluate the model performance, i.e. coefficient of determination (R2), bias and model efficiency according to Nash Sutcliffe (NSE). The model was applied to three sites with different management in Muencheberg (Germany) for the simulation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a cross-validation experiment. Field observations for model evaluation included soil water content and the dry matters of roots, storages, stems and leaves. Best parameter sets resulted in NSE of 0.57 for the simulation of soil moisture across all three sites. The shape parameter of the retention curve n was highly constrained whilst other parameters of the retention curve showed a large equifinality. The root and storage dry matter observations were predicted with a NSE of 0.94, a low bias of -58.2 kg ha-1 and a high R2 of 0.98. Dry matters of stem and leaves were predicted with less, but still high accuracy (NSE = 0.79, bias = 221.7 kg ha-1, R2 = 0.87). We attribute this slightly poorer model performance to missing leaf senescence which is currently not implemented in PMF. The most constrained parameters for the plant growth model were the radiation-use-efficiency and the base temperature. Cross validation helped to identify deficits in the model structure, pointing out the need of including agricultural management options in the coupled model.},

For purposes of analysis, the basis is refined and/or its order elevated without changing the geometry or its parameterization. Analogues of finite element h- and p-refinement schemes are presented and a new, more efficient, higher-order concept, k-refinement, is introduced. Refinements are easily implemented and exact geometry is maintained at all levels without the necessity of subsequent communication with a CAD (Computer Aided Design) description. In the context of structural mechanics, it is established that the basis functions are complete with respect to affine transformations, meaning that all rigid body motions and constant strain states are exactly represented. Standard patch tests are likewise satisfied. Numerical examples exhibit optimal rates of convergence for linear elasticity problems and convergence to thin elastic shell solutions. A k-refinement strategy is shown to converge toward monotone solutions for advection--diffusion processes with sharp internal and boundary layers, a very surprising result. It is argued that isogeometric analysis is a viable alternative to standard, polynomial-based, finite element analysis and possesses several advantages.},

  abstract = {Neural networks have been shown to be extremely effective rainfall-runoff models, where the river discharge is predicted from meteorological inputs. However, the question remains: what have these models learned? Is it possible to extract information about the learned relationships that map inputs to outputs, and do these mappings represent known hydrological concepts? Small-scale experiments have demonstrated that the internal states of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), a particular neural network architecture predisposed to hydrological modelling, can be interpreted. By extracting the tensors which represent the learned translation from inputs (precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration) to outputs (discharge), this research seeks to understand what information the LSTM captures about the hydrological system. We assess the hypothesis that the LSTM replicates real-world processes and that we can extract information about these processes from the internal states of the LSTM. We examine the cell-state vector, which represents the memory of the LSTM, and explore the ways in which the LSTM learns to reproduce stores of water, such as soil moisture and snow cover. We use a simple regression approach to map the LSTM state vector to our target stores (soil moisture and snow). Good correlations (R2\&gt;0.8) between the probe outputs and the target variables of interest provide evidence that the LSTM contains information that reflects known hydrological processes comparable with the concept of variable-capacity soil moisture stores.  The implications of this study are threefold: (1) LSTMs reproduce known hydrological processes. (2) While conceptual models have theoretical assumptions embedded in the model a priori, the LSTM derives these from the data. These learned representations are interpretable by scientists. (3) LSTMs can be used to gain an estimate of intermediate stores of water such as soil moisture. While machine learning interpretability is still a nascent field and our approach reflects a simple technique for exploring what the model has learned, the results are robust to different initial conditions and to a variety of benchmarking experiments. We therefore argue that deep learning approaches can be used to advance our scientific goals as well as our predictive goals.},

They are used to further the understanding of interactions between water balance components and their past evolution as well as potential future development under various scenarios. While GHMs have been part of the hydrologist's toolbox for several decades, the models are continuously being developed. In our study, we present the HydroPy model, a revised version of an established GHM, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology's Hydrology Model (MPI-HM). Being rewritten in Python, the new model requires much less effort in maintenance, and due to its flexible infrastructure, new processes can be easily implemented. Besides providing a thorough documentation of the processes currently implemented in HydroPy, we demonstrate the skill of the model in simulating the land surface water balance. We find that evapotranspiration is reproduced realistically for the majority of the land surface but is underestimated in the tropics. The simulated river discharge correlates well with observations. Biases are evident for the annual accumulated discharge; however, they can -- at least to some extent -- be attributed to discrepancies between the meteorological model forcing data and the observations. Finally, we show that HydroPy performs very similarly to MPI-HM and thus conclude the successful transition from MPI-HM to HydroPy.},

  abstract = {Understanding the spatial distribution of organic and/or inorganic contaminants is crucial to facilitate decision-making of rehabilitation strategies in order to ensure the most appropriate management of contaminated sites in terms of contaminant removals efficiencies and operating costs. For these reasons, various interpolation methods [Thiessen Polygon (TP) method, inverse of distance (IDW) method, ordinary kriging (OK), as well as sequential Gaussian simulations (SGS)] were used to better understand the spatial distribution of As, Cr, Cu, pentachlorophenol (PCP) and dioxins and furans (PCDD/F) found onto a specific industrial site. These methods do not only vary in complexity and efficiency but also lead to different results when using values coming from the same characterization campaign. Therefore, it is often necessary to evaluate their relevance by performing a comparative analysis. The results showed that ordinary kriging (OK) was a better estimator of the mean and more advanced compared to the two other methods of interpolation (TP and IDW). However, it appeared that SGS has the same power than OK but it also permitted to calculate a reliable value of the probabilities of exceeding regulatory cut-offs of contamination.},

Analyses were performed for the Delaware Watershed at Perry Lake in eastern Kansas. Precipitation indices for DAYMET and PRISM precipitation closely matched GHCN-D, whereas NLDAS and GLDAS showed weaker correlations. We also used these precipitation data as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that confirmed similar trends in streamflow simulation. For stations with complete data, GHCN-D based SWAT-simulated streamflow variability better than gridded precipitation data. During low flow periods we found PRISM performed better, whereas both DAYMET and NLDAS performed better in high flow years. Our results demonstrate that combining gridded precipitation sources with gauge-based measurements can improve hydrologic model performance, especially for extreme events.},

The objective of this study was to compare the methods of precipitation spatial interpolation, namely, the method of Thiessen polygons (THI), Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), and Universal Kriging (UNK) using the physically based and spatially distributed hydrological WetSpa model. The paper also illustrates how these methods allow more accurate estimation of river discharge simulated with the WetSpa model for the Gharesou basin in Iran. Daily data of 22 precipitation gaging stations were used in this study. In order to simulate hydrological processes for the basin, especially river runoff, we used the precipitation data interpolated with THI, IDW, and UNK as well as digital information on topography, the land use and soil type of the basin. For comparing three interpolation methods, they were applied to the simulation of river discharge using the WetSpa model. Simulated daily values of water discharge in the basin were compared with observational data. The quality of data simulated using these three methods was very good or excellent. According to the efficiency criterion of Aggregated Measure (0.879), the application of THI method provided more accurate forecast of river discharge than that of IDW and UNK methods.},

We present a global model of irrigation requirements, which is based on a new raster map of irrigated areas. With a spatial resolution of 0.5{$^\circ$}, the model simulates the cropping patterns, the growing seasons, and the net and gross irrigation requirements, distinguishing two crops, rice and nonrice. Using long time series of monthly climatic variables, the irrigation requirements under present-day climate conditions are computed, and the impact of climate variability is analyzed. The correspondence between model results and independent estimates of irrigation water use is judged to be good enough for applying the model in global and continental studies.},

Consequently, the focal aims of the investigation are to assess the potential of machine learning models in forecasting irrigation water requirements (IWR) of snap beans by evolving multi-scenarios of inputs parameters to figure out the impact of meteorological, crop, and soil parameters on IWR. Six models were applied, support vector regressor (SVR), random forest (RF), deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and Hybrid CNN-LSTM. Ten variables including maximum and minimum temperature, Relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, a fraction of surface wetted and, exposed and soil wetted fraction were used as the input data for models with their combination, 8 input scenarios were designed. Overall models, the best scenario was scenario 4 (relative humidity, wind speed, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation), however, the best scenario for DNN and RF model was scenario 7 (root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wetted, exposed and soil wetted fraction). While the weakest one was the group of climatic factors in scenario 6 (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation). Among the models, the hybrid LTSM \& CNN was the most accurate and the SVR model had the lowest estimation accuracy. The outcomes of this research work could set up a modeling strategy that would set in motion the improvement of efforts to identify the shortages in IWR forecasting, which sequentially may support alleviation strategies such as policies for sustainable water use and water resources management. The current approach was promising and has research value for other similar regions.},

  abstract = {Groundwater-based irrigation has dramatically expanded over the past decades. It has important implications for terrestrial water, energy fluxes, and food production, as well as local to regional climates. However, irrigation water use is hard to monitor at large scales due to various constraints, including the high cost of metering equipment installation and maintenance, privacy issues, and the presence of illegal or unregistered wells. This study estimates irrigation water amounts using machine learning to integrate in situ pumping records, remote sensing products, and climate data in the Kansas High Plains. We use a random forest regression to estimate the annual irrigation water amount at a reprojected spatial resolution of 6 km based on various data, including remotely sensed vegetation indices and evapotranspiration (ET), land cover, near-surface meteorological forcing, and a satellite-derived irrigation map. In addition, we assess the value of ECOSTRESS ET products for irrigation water use estimation and compare with the baseline results by using MODIS ET. The random forest regression model can capture the temporal and spatial variability of irrigation amounts with a satisfactory accuracy (R2 = 0.82). It performs reasonably well when it is calibrated on the western portion of the study area and tested on the eastern portion that receives more rain than the western one, suggesting its potential transferability to other regions. ECSOTRESS ET and MODIS ET yield a similar irrigation estimation accuracy.},

The DHFs include land use patterns, population densities, information about water and agricultural management, and fishing intensities. The ISIMIP3a impact model simulations driven by these observation-based climate-related and direct human forcings are designed to test to what degree the impact models can explain observed changes in natural and human systems. In a second set of ISIMIP3a experiments the participating impact models are forced by the same DHFs but a counterfactual set of atmospheric forcings and coastal water levels where observed trends have been removed.

  abstract = {The Xinanjiang model provides a statistically integral structure to describe the runoff generation on partial areas over a catchment. In the original version of the model, a single parabolic curve is used to describe the soil moisture variation. In reality however, the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture is quite complex because many different states, which change with seasons of the year, co-exist in the catchment. In this study, a more general double parabolic curve is proposed to describe the complex soil moisture variation. It consists of lower and upper branches, with the lower branch for the wet condition, the upper branch for the dry condition, and a smooth transition. Two parameters, c and b represent the relative weight between the lower and the upper branches and their gradients. The single parabolic curve of the original Xinanjiang model can be thought of as a special case of the proposed double parabolic curve. Both the single and double parabolic curves perform similarly when used with storm events isolated from daily data in the wet seasons, but the double parabolic curve improves the predictions significantly when used with data from the dry seasons. When used with hourly event data there is no significant difference between the two curves because of the dominance of the wet soil moisture condition. Even in this case, the double parabolic curve differentiates the parameter values more clearly for different soil moisture states. There is also a slight improvement on the predictions for storms in the dry seasons.},

Data from an experimental basin (Weierbach, Luxembourg) is used to analyze four conceptual models of varying complexity, over time scales of 30 min to 3 days, using several combinations of numerical implementations and inference equations. Large spurious time scale trends arise in the parameter estimates when unreliable time-stepping approximations are employed and/or when the heteroscedasticity of the model residual errors is ignored. Conversely, the use of robust numerics and more adequate (albeit still clearly imperfect) likelihood functions markedly stabilizes and, in many cases, reduces the time scale dependencies and improves the identifiability of increasingly complex model structures. Parameters describing slow flow remained essentially constant over the range of subhourly to daily scales considered here, while parameters describing quick flow converged toward increasingly precise and stable estimates as the data resolution approached the characteristic time scale of these faster processes. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations based on numerical error analysis and data-averaging considerations. Additional diagnostics confirmed the improved ability of the more complex models to reproduce distinct signatures in the observed data. More broadly, this study provides insights into the information content of hydrological data and, by advocating careful attention to robust numericostatistical analysis and stringent process-oriented diagnostics, furthers the utilization of dense-resolution data and experimental insights to advance hypothesis-based hydrological modeling at the catchment scale.},

  abstract = {Water resources managers must increasingly consider climate change implications of, whether the concern is floods, droughts, reservoir management, or reliably supplying consumers. Hydrologic and water quality modeling of future climate scenarios requires understanding global climate models (GCMs), emission scenarios and downscaling GCM output, since GCMs generate climate predictions at a resolution too coarse for watershed modeling. Here we present theoretical considerations needed to understand the various downscaling methods. Since most watershed modelers will not be performing independent downscaling, given the resource and time requirements needed, we also present a practical workflow for selecting downscaled datasets. Even given the availability of a number of downscaled datasets, a number of decisions are needed regarding downscaling approach (statistical vs. dynamic), GCMs to consider, options, climate statistics to consider for the selection of model(s) that best predict the historical period, and the relative importance of different climate statistics. Available dynamically-downscaled datasets are more limited in GCMs and time periods considered, but the watershed modeler should consider the approach that best matches the historical observations. We critically assess the existing downscaling approaches and then provide practical considerations (which scenarios and GCMs have been downscaled? What are some of the limitations of these databases? What are the steps to selecting a downscaling approach?) Many of these practical questions have not been addressed in previous reviews. While there is no ``best approach'' that will work for every watershed, having a systematic approach for selecting the multiple options can serve to make an informed and supportable decision.},

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

  abstract = {Runoff conditions are strongly controlled by climate. Therefore, any uncertainties in the projections about future climate directly translate to uncertainties in future runoff. If several climate models are applied with the same emission scenario, there may be large differences in the climate projections due to model related biases and natural climate variability. To address this issue, an ensemble modelling approach -- which considers a set of climate models -- is applied in this study with a monthly, conceptual hydrological model for assessing future runoff conditions in the upper Danube basin (101,810km2). Observed data of the past 120years of the HISTALP data-set are used to evaluate runoff simulations under historic climate variations as well as to test the delta-change method for bias correction of climate data. Uncertainties caused by the hydrological model or by the method for bias correction appear to be small. Projections about future climate are obtained from 21 regional climate models (RCMs) of the ENSEMBLES project for the A1B emission scenario. Evaluation and ranking of the RCMs reveals that some of the models have considerable biases in simulation of spatio-temporal patterns of historic precipitation and temperature. There is however, no systematic relationship between historic performance and projected future change. Even for the better performing RCMs the differences in the simulation results are large. This is a strong argument for using an ensemble modelling approach, which yields a range of future runoff conditions instead of a deterministic projection. In general, a strong decrease of summer runoff is simulated, whereas there is no clear signal for changes in winter runoff. The spread between different RCMs in future seasonal runoff is larger than for the monthly flow duration curve. Overall, the projected changes in future runoff conditions become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Watershed scale models simulating hydrological and water quality processes have advanced rapidly in sophistication, process representation, flexibility in model structure, and input data. With calibration being an inevitable step prior to any model application, there is need for a simple procedure to assess whether or not a parameter should be adjusted for calibration. We provide a rationale for a hierarchical selection of parameters to adjust during calibration and recommend that modelers progress from parameters that are most uncertain to parameters that are least uncertain, namely starting with pure calibration parameters, followed by derived parameters, and finally measured parameters. We show that different information contained in time and frequency domains can provide useful insight regarding the selection of parameters to adjust in calibration. For example, wavelet coherence analysis shows time periods and scales where a particular parameter is sensitive. The second component of the paper discusses model performance evaluation measures. Given the importance of these models to support decision-making for a wide range of environmental issues, the hydrology community is compelled to improve the metrics used to evaluate model performance. More targeted and comprehensive metrics will facilitate better and more efficient calibration and will help demonstrate that the model is useful for the intended purpose. Here, we introduce a suite of new tools for model evaluation, packaged as an open-source Hydrologic Model Evaluation (HydroME) Toolbox. We apply these tools in the calibration and evaluation of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models of two watersheds, the Le Sueur River Basin (2880 km2) and Root River Basin (4300 km2) in southern Minnesota, USA.},

  abstract = {Regional rainfall--runoff modeling is an old but still mostly outstanding problem in the hydrological sciences. The problem currently is that traditional hydrological models degrade significantly in performance when calibrated for multiple basins together instead of for a single basin alone. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate that under a ``big data'' paradigm, this is not necessarily the case. By training a single LSTM model on 531 basins from the CAMELS dataset using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally, but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM (EA-LSTM), that allows for learning catchment similarities as a feature layer in a deep learning model. We show that these learned catchment similarities correspond well to what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.},

Achieving such a balance is most difficult in arid and semi-arid regions. Hydrological and ecosystem models are often the tools being employed to address these resource-allocation issues. The inter-disciplinary nature of water- and environmental-resource problems requires the use of modelling approaches that can incorporate knowledge from a broad range of scientific disciplines. Selection and application of appropriate models and tools is a function of a number of evaluation criteria, including problem objectives, data constraints, and spatial and temporal scales of application. The US Geological Survey (USGS) Modular Modelling System (MMS) (Leavesley et al., 1996b) is an integrated system of computer software that provides a research and operational framework to support the development and integration of a wide variety of hydrologic and ecosystem models, and their application to water- and environmental-resources management. MMS supports the integration of models and tools at a variety of levels of modular design. These include individual process models, tightly coupled models, loosely coupled models, and fully integrated decision-support systems. A geographic information system (GIS) interface, the GIS Weasel, has been integrated with MMS to enable spatial delineation and characterization of basin and ecosystem features, and to provide objective parameter-estimation methods for selected models using available digital data coverages.},

The Liu model was tested against the Rutter model on a single-storm basis with interception measurements observed from an old-growth Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii ) forest in Oregon, USA. Simulated results by the Liu model were close to the measurements and comparable to those predicted by the Rutter model. The Liu model was further tested against the Gash model on a multistorm basis. The Gash and Liu models successfully predicted long-term interception losses from a broad range of 20 forests around the world. Results also indicated that both the Gash and the Liu models could be used to predict rainfall interception using daily rainfall data, although it was assumed in both models that there is only one storm per rain day. The sensitivity of the Liu model to stand storage capacity, canopy gap fraction and evaporation rate from wet canopy surface during rainfall was investigated. Results indicate that the Liu model has the simplest form, least data requirements and comparable accuracy for predicting rainfall interception as compared with the Rutter and the Gash models.

  abstract = {The present master's thesis examines uncertainty and sensitivity in hydrological modeling, focusing mainly on the model structure. The goal of the analysis is to identify model construction and assess uncertainty in modeling. The focus is on the independent and dependent elements from five model construction elements: parameters, boundary conditions, physiographic data, module, process, and model. The analysis is conducted both before and after model calibration, using the EDCHM model framework, and a total of 34 Saxony catchments are examined. To investigate uncertainty, output data distributions and crash-tests are conducted, while sensitivity indices, improvement indices, and parameter-class indices are analyzed for sensitivity. The analysis shows that different catchments have different sensitivities to processes, but in main catchments, the differences are significantly smaller. Model parameters are sensitive to various physiographic data. Therefore, before applying a modular model framework, it is recommended to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of model construction for specific catchments. The discretization of model unit surfaces and boundary condition data is beneficial for modeling in all catchments. Despite model calibration, uncertainties in the water balance persist. The study demonstrates the all-around uncertainty in hydrological modeling and the strong method of analyzing sensitivity. In the end, a strategy is recommended to identify the model structure for specific catchment.},

This paper presents the Modular Assessment of Rainfall-Runoff Models Toolbox (MARRMoT): a modular open-source toolbox containing documentation and model code for 46 existing conceptual hydrologic models. The toolbox is developed in Matlab and works with Octave. Models are implemented following several best practices: definition of model equations (the mathematical model) is kept separate from the numerical methods used to solve these equations (the numerical model) to generate clean code that is easy to adjust and debug; the Implicit Euler time-stepping scheme is provided as the default option to numerically approximate each model's Ordinary Differential Equations in a more robust way than (common) Explicit schemes would; threshold equations are smoothed to avoid discontinuities in the model's objective function space; and the model equations are solved simultaneously, avoiding physically unrealistic sequential solving of fluxes. Generalized parameter ranges are provided to assist with model inter-comparison studies. In addition to this paper and its Supporting Materials, a User Manual is provided together with several workflow scripts that show basic example applications of the toolbox. The toolbox and documentation are available from https://github.com/wknoben/MARRMoT (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2482542). Our main scientific objective in developing this toolbox is to facilitate the inter-comparison of conceptual hydrological model structures which are in widespread use, in order to ultimately reduce the uncertainty in model structure selection.},

  abstract = {The model calibration is one of the essential processes in the land surface model (LSM) simulations to achieve high performance and predictability for the use in integrated water resources and disaster risk management to climate change. Since the performance criteria often used to evaluate or calibrate hydrological models have their own advantages and limitations, it is necessary to understand the nature of each performance criterion in the model performance assessment or identification to the model application purpose. For the design flow estimates from hydrological modeling data, the Liu Mean Efficiency (LME) was proposed by reformulating the three metric components (correlation, variability, and bias measures) in the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) or the Kling and Gupta Efficiency (KGE) to improve flow variability in the runoff simulations optimized with the NSE or KGE. However, the LME criterion can potentially pose serious challenges to comparative performance evaluation and reliable design flow estimation due to the underdetermined solutions towards the excessive flow variation. For a complementary approach to the limitations of the NSE, KGE, and LME, this study has therefore proposed a new rebalanced performance criterion based on the least-squares regression components combined from both-way regression analysis between simulations and observations. It has been illustrated that the proposed criterion can provide a rebalanced trade-off between the constituent metric components leading to the improved flow variability with taking advantages of the KGE through the theoretical comparative analysis and the case study for long-term weekly streamflow time series from the LSM simulations in the four study watersheds with natural unregulated flow observations.},

In contrast to currently dominant ``fixed'' model applications, the flexible framework proposed here allows the hydrologist to hypothesize, build, and test different model structures using combinations of generic components. This is particularly useful for conceptual modeling at the catchment scale, where limitations in process understanding and data availability remain major research and operational challenges. The formulation of the model architecture and individual components to represent distinct aspects of catchment-scale function, such as storage, release, and transmission of water, is discussed. Several numerical strategies for implementing the model equations within a computationally robust framework are also presented. In the companion paper, the potential of the flexible framework is examined with respect to supporting more systematic and stringent hypothesis testing, for characterizing catchment diversity, and, more generally, for aiding progress toward more unified hydrological theory at the catchment scale.},

  abstract = {Calibration is an essential step for improving the accuracy of simulations generated using hydrologic models. A key modeling decision is selecting the performance metric to be optimized. It has been common to use squared error performance metrics, or normalized variants such as Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), based on the idea that their squared-error nature will emphasize the estimates of high flows. However, we conclude that NSE-based model calibrations actually result in poor reproduction of high-flow events, such as the annual peak flows that are used for flood frequency estimation. Using three different types of performance metrics, we calibrate two hydrological models at a daily step, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM), and evaluate their ability to simulate high-flow events for 492 basins throughout the contiguous United States. The metrics investigated are (1) NSE, (2) Kling--Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its variants, and (3) annual peak flow bias (APFB), where the latter is an application-specific metric that focuses on annual peak flows. As expected, the APFB metric produces the best annual peak flow estimates; however, performance on other high-flow-related metrics is poor. In contrast, the use of NSE results in annual peak flow estimates that are more than 20\&thinsp;\% worse, primarily due to the tendency of NSE to underestimate observed flow variability. On the other hand, the use of KGE results in annual peak flow estimates that are better than from NSE, owing to improved flow time series metrics (mean and variance), with only a slight degradation in performance with respect to other related metrics, particularly when a non-standard weighting of the components of KGE is used. Stochastically generated ensemble simulations based on model residuals show the ability to improve the high-flow metrics, regardless of the deterministic performances. However, we emphasize that improving the fidelity of streamflow dynamics from deterministically calibrated models is still important, as it may improve high-flow metrics (for the right reasons). Overall, this work highlights the need for a deeper understanding of performance metric behavior and design in relation to the desired goals of model calibration.},

The genome-wide biological information, such as cancer driver mutations, aberrantly methylated regions, gene, and miRNA expression profiles, is helpful for predicting the cancer onset, subtypes, and treatment response and is valuable for improving diagnosis and therapeutic and clinical decisions. In this context, machine learning (ML) algorithms and artificial intelligence have been beneficial and essential for the better accuracy of cancer-related predictions. Here, we mainly focus on research based on these omics data, paying close attention to machine learning methods. We summarize various kinds of omics data and different ML algorithms effective in cancer prediction. We also highlighted the applications of the ML algorithm on genomic information in cancer, including cancer classification, therapy response, survival, metastasis, and biomarker identification. Further we discussed the novel approaches in machine learning for improving cancer prediction.

  abstract = {The spatial variability of landscape features such as topography, soils and vegetation defines the spatial pattern of hydrological state variables like soil moisture. Spatial variability thereby controls the functional behaviour of the landscape in terms of its runoff response. A consequence of spatial variability is that exchange processes between landscape patches can occur at various spatial scales ranging from the plot to the basin scale. In semi-arid areas, the lateral redistribution of surface runoff between adjacent landscape patches is an important process. For applications to large river basins of 104--105km2 in size, a multi-scale landscape discretization scheme is presented in this paper. The landscape is sub-divided into modelling units within a hierarchy of spatial scale levels. By delineating areas characterized by a typical toposequence, organised and random variability of landscape characteristics is captured in the model. Using runoff--runon relationships with transition frequencies based on areal fractions of modelling units, lateral surface and subsurface water fluxes between modelling units at the hillslope scale are represented. Thus, the new approach allows for a manageable description of interactions between fine-scale landscape features for inclusion in coarse-scale models. Model applications for the State of Cear{\'a} (148,000 km2) in the north-east of Brazil demonstrate the importance of taking into account landscape variability and interactions between landscape patches in a semi-arid environment. Using mean landscape characteristics leads to a considerable underestimation of infiltration-excess surface runoff and total simulated runoff. Re-infiltration of surface runoff and lateral redistribution processes between landscape patches cause a reduction of runoff volumes at the basin scale and contribute to the amplification of variations in runoff volumes relative to variations in rainfall volumes for semi-arid areas.},

Given uncertainties in the observational data we use to drive and evaluate hydrological models, and uncertainties in the structure and parameterisation of models we use to produce hydrological simulations and predictions, it is essential that model evaluation is undertaken within an uncertainty analysis framework. Here, we benchmark the capability of several lumped hydrological models across Great Britain by focusing on daily flow and peak flow simulation. Four hydrological model structures from the Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) were applied to over 1000 catchments in England, Wales and Scotland. Model performance was then evaluated using standard performance metrics for daily flows and novel performance metrics for peak flows considering parameter uncertainty.  Our results show that lumped hydrological models were able to produce adequate simulations across most of Great Britain, with each model producing simulations exceeding a 0.5 Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency for at least 80\&thinsp;\% of catchments. All four models showed a similar spatial pattern of performance, producing better simulations in the wetter catchments to the west and poor model performance in central Scotland and south-eastern England. Poor model performance was often linked to the catchment water balance, with models unable to capture the catchment hydrology where the water balance did not close. Overall, performance was similar between model structures, but different models performed better for different catchment characteristics and metrics, as well as for assessing daily or peak flows, leading to the ensemble of model structures outperforming any single structure, thus demonstrating the value of using multi-model structures across a large sample of different catchment behaviours.  This research evaluates what conceptual lumped models can achieve as a performance benchmark and provides interesting insights into where and why these simple models may fail. The large number of river catchments included in this study makes it an appropriate benchmark for any future developments of a national model of Great Britain.},

  abstract = {In the field of hydrological modeling, many alternative representations of natural processes exist. Choosing specific process formulations when building a hydrological model is therefore associated with a high degree of ambiguity and subjectivity. In addition, the numerical integration of the underlying differential equations and parametrization of model structures influence model performance. Identifiability analysis may provide guidance by constraining the a priori range of alternatives based on observations. In this work, a flexible simulation environment is used to build an ensemble of semidistributed, process-based hydrological model configurations with alternative process representations, numerical integration schemes, and model parametrizations in an integrated manner. The flexible simulation environment is coupled with an approach for dynamic identifiability analysis. The objective is to investigate the applicability of the framework to identify the most adequate model. While an optimal model configuration could not be clearly distinguished, interesting results were obtained when relating model identifiability with hydro-meteorological boundary conditions. For instance, we tested the Penman-Monteith and Shuttleworth \& Wallace evapotranspiration models and found that the former performs better under wet and the latter under dry conditions. Parametrization of model structures plays a dominant role as it can compensate for inadequate process representations and poor numerical solvers. Therefore, it was found that numerical solvers of high order of accuracy do often, though not necessarily, lead to better model performance. The proposed coupled framework proved to be a straightforward diagnostic tool for model building and hypotheses testing and shows potential for more in-depth analysis of process implementations and catchment functioning.},

  abstract = {Global-scale assessments of freshwater fluxes and storages by hydrological models under historic climate conditions are subject to a variety of uncertainties. Using the global hydrological model WaterGAP (Water -- Global Assessment and Prognosis) 2.2, we investigated the sensitivity of simulated freshwater fluxes and water storage variations to five major sources of uncertainty: climate forcing, land cover input, model structure/refinements, consideration of human water use and calibration (or no calibration) against observed mean river discharge. In a modeling experiment, five variants of the standard version of WaterGAP 2.2 were generated that differed from the standard version only regarding the investigated source of uncertainty. The basin-specific calibration approach for WaterGAP was found to have the largest effect on grid cell fluxes as well as on global AET (actual evapotranspiration) and discharge into oceans for the period 1971--2000. Regarding grid cell fluxes, climate forcing ranks second before land cover input. Global water storage trends are most sensitive to model refinements (mainly modeling of groundwater depletion) and consideration of human water use. The best fit to observed time series of monthly river discharge or discharge seasonality is obtained with the standard WaterGAP 2.2 model version which is calibrated and driven by daily reanalysis-based WFD/WFDEI (combination of Watch Forcing Data based on ERA40 and Watch Forcing Data based on ERA-Interim) climate data. Discharge computed by a calibrated model version using monthly CRU TS (Climate Research Unit time-series) 3.2 and GPCC (Global Precipitation Climatology Center) v6 climate input reduced the fit to observed discharge for most stations. Taking into account uncertainties of climate and land cover data, global 1971--2000 discharge into oceans and inland sinks ranges between 40 000 and 42 000 km3 yr-1. Global actual evapotranspiration, with 70 000 km3 yr-1, is rather unaffected by climate and land cover uncertainties. Human water use reduced river discharge by 1000 km3 yr-1, such that global renewable water resources are estimated to range between 41 000 and 43 000 km3 yr-1. The climate data sets WFD (available until 2001) and WFDEI (starting in 1979) were found to be inconsistent with respect to shortwave radiation data, resulting in strongly different actual evapotranspiration. Global assessments of freshwater fluxes and storages would therefore benefit from the development of a global data set of consistent daily climate forcing from 1900 to present.},

  abstract = {When assessing global water resources with hydrological models, it is essential to know about methodological uncertainties. The values of simulated water balance components may vary due to different spatial and temporal aggregations, reference periods, and applied climate forcings, as well as due to the consideration of human water use, or the lack thereof. We analyzed these variations over the period 1901\&ndash;2010 by forcing the global hydrological model WaterGAP 2.2 (ISIMIP2a) with five state-of-the-art climate data sets, including a homogenized version of the concatenated WFD/WFDEI data set. Absolute values and temporal variations of global water balance components are strongly affected by the uncertainty in the climate forcing, and no temporal trends of the global water balance components are detected for the four homogeneous climate forcings considered (except for human water abstractions). The calibration of WaterGAP against observed long-term average river discharge Q significantly reduces the impact of climate forcing uncertainty on estimated Q and renewable water resources. For the homogeneous forcings, Q of the calibrated and non-calibrated regions of the globe varies by 1.6 and 18.5 \%, respectively, for 1971\&ndash;2000. On the continental scale, most differences for long-term average precipitation P and Q estimates occur in Africa and, due to snow undercatch of rain gauges, also in the data-rich continents Europe and North America. Variations of Q at the grid-cell scale are large, except in a few grid cells upstream and downstream of calibration stations, with an average variation of 37 and 74 \% among the four homogeneous forcings in calibrated and non-calibrated regions, respectively. Considering only the forcings GSWP3 and WFDEI\_hom, i.e., excluding the forcing without undercatch correction (PGFv2.1) and the one with a much lower shortwave downward radiation SWD than the others (WFD), Q variations are reduced to 16 and 31 \% in calibrated and non-calibrated regions, respectively. These simulation results support the need for extended Q measurements and data sharing for better constraining global water balance assessments. Over the 20th century, the human footprint on natural water resources has become larger. For 11\&ndash;18\% of the global land area, the change of Q between 1941\&ndash;1970 and 1971\&ndash;2000 was driven more strongly by change of human water use including dam construction than by change in precipitation, while this was true for only 9\&ndash;13 \% of the land area from 1911\&ndash;1940 to 1941\&ndash;1970.},

  abstract = {Isogeometric analysis (IGA) represents a recently developed technology in computational mechanics that offers the possibility of integrating methods for analysis and Computer Aided Design (CAD) into a single, unified process. The implications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic gains in efficiency. In this manuscript, through a self-contained Matlab{\textregistered} implementation, we present an introduction to IGA applied to simple analysis problems and the related computer implementation aspects. Furthermore, implementation of the extended IGA which incorporates enrichment functions through the partition of unity method (PUM) is also presented, where several examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are illustrated. We also describe the use of IGA in the context of strong-form (collocation) formulations, which has been an area of research interest due to the potential for significant efficiency gains offered by these methods. The code which accompanies the present paper can be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear elasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics (beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson problems with or without enrichment. The B{\'e}zier extraction concept that allows the FE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also incorporated. The article includes a summary of recent trends and developments within the field of IGA.},

  abstract = {Due to population growth and human activities, water shortages have become an increasingly serious concern in the North China Plain, which has become the world's largest underground water funnel. Because the yield per unit area, planting area of crops, and effective precipitation in the region are uncertain, it is not easy to plan the amount of irrigation water for crops. In order to improve the applicability of the uncertainty programming model, a hybrid LSTM-CPP-FPP-IPP model (long short-term memory, chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was developed to plan the irrigation water allocation of irrigation system under uncertainty. The LSTM (long short-term memory) model was used to predict crop yield per unit area, and CPP-FPP-IPP programming (chance-constrained programming, fuzzy possibility programming, interval parameter programming) was used to plan the crop area and the effective precipitation under uncertainty. The hybrid model was used for the crop production profit of winter wheat and summer corn in five cities in the North China Plain. The average absolute error between the model prediction value and the actual value of the yield per unit area of winter wheat and summer maize in four cities in 2020 was controlled within the range of 14.02 to 696.66 kg/hectare. It shows that the model can more accurately predict the yield per unit area of crops. The planning model for the benefit of irrigation water allocation generated three scenarios of rainfall level and four planting intentions, and compared the planned scenarios with the actual production benefits of the two crops in 2020. In a dry year, the possibility of planting areas for winter wheat and summer corn is optimized. Compared with the traditional deterministic planning method, the model takes into account the uncertain parameters, which helps decision makers seek better solutions under uncertain conditions.},

  abstract = {Global hydrological models (GHMs) supply key information for stakeholders and policymakers simulating past, present and future water cycles. Inaccuracy in GHM simulations, i.e. simulation results that poorly match observations, leads to uncertainty that hinders valuable decision support. Improved parameter estimation is one key to more accurate simulations of global models. Here, we introduce an efficient and transparent way to understand the parameter control of GHMs to advance parameter estimation using global sensitivity analysis (GSA). In our analysis, we use the GHM WaterGAP3 and find that the most influential parameters in 50\% of 347 basins worldwide are model parameters that have traditionally not been included when calibrating this model. Parameter importance varies in space and between metrics. For example, a parameter that controls groundwater flow velocity is influential on signatures related to the flow duration curve but not on traditional statistical metrics. Parameters linked to evapotranspiration and high flows exhibit unexpected behaviour, i.e. a parameter defining potential evapotranspiration influences high flows more than other parameters we would have expected to be relevant. This unexpected behaviour suggests that the model structure could be improved. We also find that basin attributes explain the spatial variability of parameter importance better than K{\"o}ppen--Geiger climate zones. Overall, our results demonstrate that GSA can effectively inform parameter estimation in GHMs and guide the improvement of the model structure. Thus, using GSA to advance parameter estimation supports more accurate simulations of the global water cycle and more robust information for stakeholders and policymakers.},

Sector-specific water demand, groundwater and surface water withdrawal, water consumption, and return flows are dynamically calculated at every time step and interact directly with the simulated hydrology. PCR-GLOBWB 2 has been fully rewritten in Python and PCRaster Python and has a modular structure, allowing easier replacement, maintenance, and development of model components. PCR-GLOBWB 2 has been implemented at 5\&thinsp;arcmin resolution, but a version parameterized at 30\&thinsp;arcmin resolution is also available. Both versions are available as open-source codes on https://github.com/UU-Hydro/PCR-GLOBWB\_model (Sutanudjaja et al., 2017a). PCR-GLOBWB 2 has its own routines for groundwater dynamics and surface water routing. These relatively simple routines can alternatively be replaced by dynamically coupling PCR-GLOBWB 2 to a global two-layer groundwater model and 1-D--2-D hydrodynamic models. Here, we describe the main components of the model, compare results of the 30 and 5\&thinsp;arcmin versions, and evaluate their model performance using Global Runoff Data Centre discharge data. Results show that model performance of the 5\&thinsp;arcmin version is notably better than that of the 30\&thinsp;arcmin version. Furthermore, we compare simulated time series of total water storage (TWS) of the 5\&thinsp;arcmin model with those observed with GRACE, showing similar negative trends in areas of prevalent groundwater depletion. Also, we find that simulated total water withdrawal matches reasonably well with reported water withdrawal from AQUASTAT, while water withdrawal by source and sector provide mixed results.},

  abstract = {A turgid leaf exposed to bright sunshine can transpire an amount of water several times its own weight during a summer day. Rapid evaporation is sustained by a supply of heat from the atmosphere and by a movement of water within the plant preventing the desiccation of leaf tissue. In analysis, the need for energy and the need for water have often been disassociated. Meteorologists investigating the energetics of transpiration have assumed that leaves behave like pieces of wet, green blotting paper, and plant physiologists have demonstrated mechanisms for the conduction of water at arbitrary rates unrelated to the physics of the environment. This paper describes progress towards a reconciliation of parallel concepts in meteorology and physiology. The path for the diffusion of water vapour from leaf cells to the free atmosphere is divided into two parts, one determined primarily by the size and distribution of stomata, and the other by wind speed and the aerodynamic properties of the plant surface. Diffusive resistances for single leaves and for plant communities are established from measurements in the laboratory and in the field and are then used: (i) to predict relative rates of evaporation from leaves with wet and dry surfaces; (ii) to investigate the dependence of transpiration rate on wind speed and surface roughness; (iii) to demonstrate that the relation between transpiration rate and lead area is governed by stomatal closure in leaves well shaded from sunlight; (iv) to calculate maximum rates of transpiration for different crops and climates. A final section on the convection of dry air stresses the importance of physiological restraint on the rate of transpiration from an irrigated field surrounded by dry land.},

The value of 27 PE models was assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States.While trying to identify which atmospheric variables were the most relevant to compute PE as input to rainfall--runoff models, we showed that the formulae based on temperature and radiation tend to provide the best streamflow simulations. Surprisingly, PE approaches based on the Penman approach seem less advantageous to feed rainfall--runoff models.This investigation has resulted in a proposal for a temperature-based PE model, combining simplicity and efficiency, and adapted to four rainfall--runoff models. This PE model only requires mean air temperature (derived from long-term averages) and leads to a slight but steady improvement in rainfall--runoff model efficiency.},

  abstract = {Rainfall--runoff modelling is one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology. Various approaches exist, ranging from physically based over conceptual to fully data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a special type of recurrent neural network. The advantage of the LSTM is its ability to learn long-term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network, which are essential for modelling storage effects in e.g. catchments with snow influence. We use 241 catchments of the freely available CAMELS data set to test our approach and also compare the results to the well-known Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA) coupled with the Snow-17 snow routine. We also show the potential of the LSTM as a regional hydrological model in which one model predicts the discharge for a variety of catchments. In our last experiment, we show the possibility to transfer process understanding, learned at regional scale, to individual catchments and thereby increasing model performance when compared to a LSTM trained only on the data of single catchments. Using this approach, we were able to achieve better model performance as the SAC-SMA\&thinsp;+\&thinsp;Snow-17, which underlines the potential of the LSTM for hydrological modelling applications.},

Three numerical hydrogeological models were generated on Visual Modflow{\textregistered}. Once created, the models were calibrated using the WinPEST{\textregistered}. GHB, River and Stream boundary conditions resulted on a calibrated standard Root Mean Square (RMS) varying from 7.3\% to 13.02\% and showed high correlation coefficients, varying from 94\% to 97\%. Using another set of hydraulic head field data, these models were later validated. New hydrological insights for the region Results show that, for all three boundary conditions, the normalized RMS obtained in calibration was similar to that obtained in validation, confirming its validity. The Rivers boundary condition have presented the most representative values for normalized RMS, absolute average error and correlation coefficient, and are the most indicated boundary conditions for areas with similar physical characteristics to the area under study.},

  abstract = {Accurately measuring water use by the economy is essential for developing reliable models of water resource availability. Indeed, these models rely on retrospective analyses that provide insights into shifting human population demands and adaptions to water shortages. However, accurate, methodologically consistent, empirically authentic, and spatiotemporally comprehensive historical datasets for water withdrawals are scarce. Herein, we present a reanalysis of annual resolution (1950--2016) historical data set on irrigation, electric power, and public supply water withdrawal within the conterminous United States (US) at the county-level, and, for power plants, at the site-level. To estimate electric power water use, we synthesized a historically comprehensive list of generators and historic patterns in generation across fuels, prime movers, and cooling technologies. Irrigation water use estimation required building a crop-demand model that utilized historical information on irrigated acreage for crops and golf courses, stage-specific crop water demand, and climate information. To estimate public water supply use, we developed a random forest model constructed from information on population, infrastructure, climate, and land cover. These estimates generally agree with total county and state water use information provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS) water use circular and estimates generated from independent studies for specific years. However, we also observed discrepancies between our estimates and USGS data that appear to be caused by inconsistencies in the methods used by the USGS's primary data sources at the state level over decades of data collection, highlighting the importance of reanalysis to yield spatiotemporally consistent and intercomparable estimates of water use.},

This algorithm reduced the root mean square error of reservoir release and river discharge simulations from that of earlier global river discharge simulations that neglected reservoir operations or substituted an algorithm for natural-lake outflow. The 2-year global simulation results indicate that reservoir operations substantially altered monthly discharge for individual basins (i.e., by more than 20\%). Averaged over the continental scale, the maximum change in monthly river discharge varied from 0\% to 34\% and the changes in reservoir storage were small as a proportion of the total storage capacity.},

Such information can support the identification of environmental flow guidelines and a sustainable water management that balances the water demands of humans and ecosystems. This study presents the first global assessment of the anthropogenic alteration of river flow regimes, in particular of flow variability, by water withdrawals and dams/reservoirs. Six ecologically relevant flow indicators were quantified using an improved version of the global water model WaterGAP. WaterGAP simulated, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree, river discharge as affected by human water withdrawals and dams around the year 2000, as well as naturalized discharge without this type of human interference. Compared to naturalized conditions, long-term average global discharge into oceans and internal sinks has decreased by 2.7\% due to water withdrawals, and by 0.8\% due to dams. Mainly due to irrigation, long-term average river discharge and statistical low flow Q90 (monthly river discharge that is exceeded in 9 out of 10 months) have decreased by more than 10\% on one sixth and one quarter of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland), respectively. Q90 has increased significantly on only 5\% of the land area, downstream of reservoirs. Due to both water withdrawals and reservoirs, seasonal flow amplitude has decreased significantly on one sixth of the land area, while interannual variability has increased on one quarter of the land area mainly due to irrigation. It has decreased on only 8\% of the land area, in areas downstream of reservoirs where consumptive water use is low. The impact of reservoirs is likely underestimated by our study as small reservoirs are not taken into account. Areas most affected by anthropogenic river flow alterations are the Western and Central USA, Mexico, the western coast of South America, the Mediterranean rim, Southern Africa, the semi-arid and arid countries of the Near East and Western Asia, Pakistan and India, Northern China and the Australian Murray-Darling Basin, as well as some Arctic rivers. Due to a large number of uncertainties related e.g. to the estimation of water use and reservoir operation rules, the analysis is expected to provide only first estimates of river flow alterations that should be refined in the future.},

  abstract = {Projecting the spatiotemporal changes in water resources under a no-analog future climate requires physically based integrated hydrologic models which simulate the transfer of water and energy across the earth's surface. These models show promise in the context of unprecedented climate extremes given their reliance on the underlying physics of the system as opposed to empirical relationships. However, these techniques are plagued by several sources of uncertainty, including the inaccuracy of input datasets such as meteorological forcing. These datasets, usually derived from climate models or satellite-based products, are typically only resolved on the order of tens to hundreds of kilometers, while hydrologic variables of interest (e.g., discharge and groundwater levels) require a resolution at much smaller scales. In this work, a high-resolution hydrologic model is forced with various resolutions of meteorological forcing (0.5 to 40.5\&thinsp;km) generated by a dynamical downscaling analysis from the regional climate model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). The Cosumnes watershed, which spans the Sierra Nevada and Central Valley interface of California (USA), exhibits semi-natural flow conditions due to its rare undammed river basin and is used here as a test bed to illustrate potential impacts of various resolutions of meteorological forcing on snow accumulation and snowmelt, surface runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and groundwater levels. Results show that the errors in spatial distribution patterns impact land surface processes and can be delayed in time. Localized biases in groundwater levels can be as large as 5--10\&thinsp;m and 3\&thinsp;m in surface water. Most hydrologic variables reveal that biases are seasonally and spatially dependent, which can have serious implications for model calibration and ultimately water management decisions.},

  abstract = {Meteorological forcing plays a critical role in accurately simulating the watershed hydrological cycle. With the advancement of high-performance computing and the development of integrated watershed models, simulating the watershed hydrological cycle at high temporal (hourly to daily) and spatial resolution (tens of meters) has become efficient and computationally affordable. These hyperresolution watershed models require high resolution of meteorological forcing as model input to ensure the fidelity and accuracy of simulated responses. In this study, we utilized the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), an integrated watershed model, to simulate surface and subsurface flow and land surface processes using unstructured meshes at the Coal Creek Watershed near Crested Butte (Colorado). We compared simulated watershed hydrologic responses including streamflow and distributed variables such as evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent (SWE), and groundwater table driven by three publicly available, gridded meteorological forcings (GMFs) -- Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries (Daymet), the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS). By comparing various spatial resolutions (ranging from 400 m to 4 km) of PRISM, the simulated streamflow only becomes marginally worse when spatial resolution of meteorological forcing is coarsened to 4 km (or 30 \% of the watershed area). However, the 4 km-resolution has much worse performance than finer resolution in spatially distributed variables such as SWE. Using the temporally disaggregated PRISM, we compared models forced by different temporal resolutions (hourly to daily), and sub-daily resolution preserves the dynamic watershed responses (e.g., diurnal fluctuation of streamflow) that are absent in results forced by daily resolution. Conversely, the simulated streamflow shows better performance using daily resolution compared to that using sub-daily resolution. Our findings suggest that the choice of GMF and its spatiotemporal resolution depends on the quantity of interest and its spatial and temporal scale, which may have important implications for model calibration and watershed management decisions.},

Dams and reservoirs are key tools for controlling and managing water resources; they have benefited human cultures in a variety of ways, including enhanced human health, increased food production, water supply for domestic and industrial use, economic growth, irrigation, hydro-power generation, and flood control. This study aims to compare the application of deep learning and conventional machine learning algorithms for predicting daily reservoir inflow. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has been applied as a deep learning algorithm and boosted regression tree (BRT) has been implemented as a machine learning algorithm. Five statistical indices have been selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The selected statistical measurements are mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE), Nash Sutcliffe Model Efficiency Coefficient (NSE), and the RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The findings showed that LSTM outperformed BRT with a significant difference in terms of accuracy.},

They have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general, however, there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges. Here we provide such a review, covering water demand forecasting, leakage and contamination detection, sewer defect assessment, wastewater system state prediction, asset monitoring and urban flooding. We find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks, synthetic data, laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported. Leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day-to-day operation and management of urban water systems, compared with other problems reviewed. Five research challenges, i.e., data privacy, algorithmic development, explainability and trustworthiness, multi-agent systems and digital twins, are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management. Future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy. We hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world.},

Under the GSWP, the global soil moisture distribution on 1{$^\circ\times$}1{$^\circ$} mesh for 1987 and 1988 was simulated in an offline mode by 11 land surface models (LSMs). Even though the forcing conditions are mostly based on observations, validation studies are necessary because LSMs may not simulate accurately the partitioning of water at the surface of the earth between runoff, evaporation, and changes in soil moisture. A gridded 1{$^\circ\times$}1{$^\circ$} global river channel network, named Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (TRIP) is used to calculate mean runoff estimated by the LSMs for drainage areas upstream of 250 operational gauging stations. Runoff observations from these stations in 150 major river basins of the world have been collected for 1987 and 1988, and were compared with the LSM products. It was found that LSMs estimated annual runoff fairly well, with a relative root mean square error of 40\% for drainage areas with a fairly high density of raingauge observations ({$\geq$}30/106km2), which was used to prepare the forcing precipitation. The error corresponds to approximately 18\% of annual evapotranspiration. LSMs are also found to have a tendency to underestimate the annual runoff. This may be caused by underestimation of raingauges under strong wind conditions, especially for snow, because all of the LSMs underestimated the runoff for most of the drainage areas located in higher latitudes. A linear river routing model was applied for the global runoff products from the LSMs and analyzed at 250 gauging stations. The correlations between observed and simulated monthly runoff were improved for most of the LSMs by introducing the routing. River runoff information was found to be effective for the validation of water cycles on the continental scale.},

N levels depend not only on current but also past N inputs to the landscape, that have accumulated through time in legacy stores (e.g., soil, groundwater). Catchment-scale N models, that are commonly used to investigate in-stream N levels, rarely examine the magnitude and dynamics of legacy components. This study aims to gain a better understanding of the long-term fate of the N inputs and its uncertainties, using a legacy-driven N model (ELEMeNT) in Germany's largest national river basin (Weser; 38,450 km2) over the period 1960--2015. We estimate the nine model parameters based on a progressive constraining strategy, to assess the value of different observational data sets. We demonstrate that beyond in-stream N loading, soil N content and in-stream N concentration allow to reduce the equifinality in model parameterizations. We find that more than 50\% of the N surplus denitrifies (1480--2210 kg ha-1) and the stream export amounts to around 18\% (410--640 kg ha-1), leaving behind as much as around 230--780 kg ha-1 of N in the (soil) source zone and 10--105 kg ha-1 in the subsurface. A sensitivity analysis reveals the importance of different factors affecting the residual uncertainties in simulated N legacies, namely hydrologic travel time, denitrification rates, a coefficient characterizing the protection of organic N in source zone and N surplus input. Our study calls for proper consideration of uncertainties in N legacy characterization, and discusses possible avenues to further reduce the equifinality in water quality modeling.},

An important question in this context is, how far can widely available hydrologic information (precipitation-temperature-streamflow data and generally available physical descriptors) be used to create a first order grouping of hydrologically similar catchments? We utilize a heterogeneous dataset of 280 catchments located in the Eastern US to understand hydrologic similarity in a 6-dimensional signature space across a region with strong environmental gradients. Signatures are defined as hydrologic response characteristics that provide insight into the hydrologic function of catchments. A Bayesian clustering scheme is used to separate the catchments into 9 homogeneous classes, which enable us to interpret hydrologic similarity with respect to similarity in climatic and landscape attributes across this region. We finally derive several hypotheses regarding controls on individual signatures from the analysis performed here.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Model structure uncertainty is known to be one of the three main sources of hydrologic model uncertainty along with input and parameter uncertainty. Some recent hydrological modeling frameworks address model structure uncertainty by supporting multiple options for representing hydrological processes. It is, however, still unclear how best to analyze structural sensitivity using these frameworks. In this work, we apply the extended Sobol' sensitivity analysis (xSSA) method that operates on grouped parameters rather than individual parameters. The method can estimate not only traditional model parameter sensitivities but is also able to provide measures of the sensitivities of process options (e.g., linear vs. non-linear storage) and sensitivities of model processes (e.g., infiltration vs. baseflow) with respect to a model output. Key to the xSSA method's applicability to process option and process sensitivity is the novel introduction of process option weights in the Raven hydrological modeling framework. The method is applied to both artificial benchmark models and a watershed model built with the Raven framework. The results show that (1) the xSSA method provides sensitivity estimates consistent with those derived analytically for individual as well as grouped parameters linked to model structure. (2) The xSSA method with process weighting is computationally less expensive than the alternative aggregate sensitivity analysis approach performed for the exhaustive set of structural model configurations, with savings of 81.9\&thinsp;\% for the benchmark model and 98.6\&thinsp;\% for the watershed case study. (3) The xSSA method applied to the hydrologic case study analyzing simulated streamflow showed that model parameters adjusting forcing functions were responsible for 42.1\&thinsp;\% of the overall model variability, while surface processes cause 38.5\&thinsp;\% of the overall model variability in a mountainous catchment; such information may readily inform model calibration and uncertainty analysis. (4) The analysis of time-dependent process sensitivities regarding simulated streamflow is a helpful tool for understanding model internal dynamics over the course of the year.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Railway systems are complex, and their analysis relies on expensive simulations, which makes incident management difficult. This paper proposes the use of sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the influence of different traffic adjustment actions (e.g., spacing between trains and speed reduction) on the train supply voltage, which must never drop below the critical value prescribed by technical standards. Three global sensitivity analysis methods dedicated to black box, multivariate, nonlinear models are considered: generalized Sobol indices, energy distance-based indices, and regional sensitivity analysis. The three methods are applied to a simple traffic rescheduling test case and give similar results, but at different costs. Regional sensitivity analysis appears to be the most suitable method for the present application: it is easy to implement, rather fast, and accounts for constraints on the system output (a key feature for electrical incident management). The application of this method to a test case representative of a real rescheduling problem shows that it provides the information needed by the traffic manager to reschedule traffic in an efficient way. The same type of approach can be used for any power system optimization problem with the same characteristics.},

They help to apply the model efficiently and to enable a focussed planning of future research and field measurement. Two different methods were used for sensitivity analyses of the complex process-oriented model TACD (tracer aided catchment model, distributed) that was applied to the meso-scale Brugga basin (40km2) and the sub-basin St Wilhelmer Talbach (15.2km2). Five simulations periods were investigated: two summer events, two snow melt induced events and one summer low flow period. The model was applied using 400 different parameter sets, which were generated by Monte Carlo simulations using latin hypercube sampling. The regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) allowed determining the most significant parameters for the complete simulation periods using a graphical method. The results of the regression-based sensitivity analysis were more detailed and complex. The temporal variability of the simulation sensitivity could be observed continuously and the significance of the parameters could be determined in a quantitative way. A dependency of the simulation sensitivity on initial- and boundary conditions and the temporal and spatial variability of the sensitivity to some model parameters was revealed by the regression-based sensitivity analysis. Thus, the difficulty of transferring the results to different time periods or model applications in other catchments became obvious. The analysis of the temporal course of the simulation sensitivity to parameter values in conjunction with simulated and measured additional data sets (precipitation, temperature, reservoir volumes etc.) gave further insight into the internal model behaviour and demonstrated the plausibility of the model structure and process conceptionalizations.},

  abstract = {Numerical weather and climate simulations nowadays produce terabytes of data, and the data volume continues to increase rapidly since an increase in resolution greatly benefits the simulation of weather and climate. In practice, however, data is often available at lower resolution only, for which there are many practical reasons, such as data coarsening to meet memory constraints, limited computational resources, favoring multiple low-resolution ensemble simulations over few high-resolution simulations, as well as limits of sensing instruments in observations. In order to enable a more insightful analysis, we investigate the capabilities of neural networks to reconstruct high-resolution data from given low-resolution simulations. For this, we phrase the data reconstruction as a super-resolution problem from multiple data sources, tailored toward meteorological and climatological data. We therefore investigate supervised machine learning using multiple deep convolutional neural network architectures to test the limits of data reconstruction for various spatial and temporal resolutions, low-frequent and high-frequent input data, and the generalization to numerical and observed data. Once such downscaling networks are trained, they serve two purposes: First, legacy low-resolution simulations can be downscaled to reconstruct high-resolution detail. Second, past observations that have been taken at lower resolutions can be increased to higher resolutions, opening new analysis possibilities. For the downscaling of high-frequent fields like precipitation, we show that error-predicting networks are far less suitable than deconvolutional neural networks due to the poor learning performance. We demonstrate that deep convolutional downscaling has the potential to become a building block of modern weather and climate analysis in both research and operational forecasting, and show that the ideal choice of the network architecture depends on the type of data to predict, i.e., there is no single best architecture for all variables.},

This concept is here adapted to assess hazards of three flow indicators: annual maximal flow, annual 7-day-average low flow, and annual mean flow. An additional in-depth analysis assesses the RPS transferability to other flow indicators and to hydrological signatures. RPS-based simulations are benchmarked with a random selection of parameter sets. The results show that i) RPSs can be successfully transferred between flow indicators with only a small drop in model performance; and ii) RPSs can be used to represent modelling uncertainty in hydrological signatures. The RPS concept has thus great potential for delineating modelling uncertainty of any environmental model.},

Values given by this formula typically differ from measured values by about 0.3 mm day-1 for annual means, 0.5 mm day-1 for monthly means, 0.9 mm day-1 for a week and 1.7 mm day-1 for a day. The formula applies over a wide range of climates. Monthly mean values of the term (T - Td) can be obtained either from an empirical table or from the following empirical relationship, provided precipitation is at least 5 mm month-1 and (T - Td) is at least 4{$^\circ$}C:(T-Td)=0.0023h+0.37T+0.53R+0.35Rann-10.9{$^\circ$}C where R is the mean daily range of temperature and Rann is the difference between the mean temperatures of the hottest and coldest months. Thus the evaporation rate can be estimated simply from values for the elevation, latitude and daily maximum and minimum temperatures.},

The Upper Wabash and Cedar Creek, two agriculture-dominated watersheds in Indiana, USA are considered as test beds to implement this multi-objective SWAT calibration. The proposed calibration approach is performed using remotely sensed Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System surface soil moisture ({$\sim$}1cm top soil) estimates (NASA's Aqua daily level-3 gridded land surface product-version 2) in sub-basin/HRU level together with observed streamflow data at the watershed's outlet. Although application of remote sensing data in calibration improves surface soil moisture simulation, other hydrologic components such as streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET) and deeper layer moisture content in SWAT remain less affected. An extension of this approach to apply root zone soil moisture estimates from limited field sensor data showed considerable improvement in the simulation of root zone moisture content and streamflow with corresponding observed data. Difference in relative sensitivity of parameters and reduced extent of uncertainty are also evident from the proposed method, especially for parameters related to the subsurface hydrologic processes. Regardless, precise representation of vertical soil moisture stratification at different layers is difficult with current SWAT ET depletion mechanism. While the results from this study show that root zone soil moisture can play a major role in SWAT calibration, more studies including various soil moisture data products are necessary to validate the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Large-scale hydrological models are nowadays mostly calibrated using observed discharge. As a result, a large part of the hydrological system, in particular the unsaturated zone, remains uncalibrated. Soil moisture observations from satellites have the potential to fill this gap. Here we evaluate the added value of remotely sensed soil moisture in calibration of large-scale hydrological models by addressing two research questions: (1) Which parameters of hydrological models can be identified by calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture? (2) Does calibration with remotely sensed soil moisture lead to an improved calibration of hydrological models compared to calibration based only on discharge observations, such that this leads to improved simulations of soil moisture content and discharge? A dual state and parameter Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to calibrate the hydrological model LISFLOOD for the Upper Danube. Calibration is done using discharge and remotely sensed soil moisture acquired by AMSR-E, SMOS, and ASCAT. Calibration with discharge data improves the estimation of groundwater and routing parameters. Calibration with only remotely sensed soil moisture results in an accurate identification of parameters related to land-surface processes. For the Upper Danube upstream area up to 40,000 km2, calibration on both discharge and soil moisture results in a reduction by 10--30\% in the RMSE for discharge simulations, compared to calibration on discharge alone. The conclusion is that remotely sensed soil moisture holds potential for calibration of hydrological models, leading to a better simulation of soil moisture content throughout the catchment and a better simulation of discharge in upstream areas.},

The model has also been adopted as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) software package and is being used by many U.S. federal and state agencies, including the USDA within the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP). At present, over 250 peer-reviewed published articles have been identified that report SWAT applications, reviews of SWAT components, or other research that includes SWAT. Many of these peer-reviewed articles are summarized here according to relevant application categories such as streamflow calibration and related hydrologic analyses, climate change impacts on hydrology, pollutant load assessments, comparisons with other models, and sensitivity analyses and calibration techniques.

  abstract = {Water availability is a key factor in territorial sustainable development. Moreover, groundwater constitutes the survival element of human life and ecosystems in arid oasis areas. Therefore, groundwater potential (GWP) identification represents a crucial step for its management and sustainable development. This study aimed to map the GWP using ten algorithms, i.e., shallow models comprising: multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine algorithms; hybrid models comprising: voting, random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting (GraB), and extreme gradient boosting; and the deep learning neural network. The GWP inventory map was prepared using 884 binary data, with ``1'' indicating a high GWP and ``0'' indicating an extremely low GWP. Twenty-three GWP-influencing factors have been classified into numerical data using the frequency ration method. Afterwards, they were selected based on their importance and multi-collinearity tests. The predicted GWP maps show that, on average, only 11\% of the total area was predicted as a very high GWP zone and 17\% and 51\% were estimated as low and very low GWP zones, respectively. The performance analyses demonstrate that the applied algorithms have satisfied the validation standards for both training and validation tests with an average area under curve of 0.89 for the receiver operating characteristic. Furthermore, the models' prioritization has selected the GraB model as the outperforming algorithm for GWP mapping. This study provides decision support tools for sustainable development in an oasis area.},

  abstract = {The choice of data periods for calibrating and evaluating conceptual hydrological models often seems ad-hoc, with no objective guidance on choosing calibration periods that produce the most reliable predictions. We therefore propose to systematically investigate the effects of calibration and validation data choices on parameter identification and predictive performance. We demonstrate our analysis on the Deggendorf/Kollbach catchment in Bavaria, Germany, for its long series of continuous hydrological and meteorological records. After classifying these data into three hydrological conditions (wet, dry and mixed) and combining them into periods of varied data length (2, 4, 8, 15, 20 and 25\,years), we repeatedly calibrate a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model -- Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) to these distinct data sets via Bayesian updating in a Monte Carlo setting. Then, we analyze predictive performance and posterior parameter statistics in various validation periods of distinct hydrological condition and time-series length. We call this the Comprehensive Differential Split-Sample Test (CDSST). Our results suggest that hydrological conditions in calibration tend to have a stronger impact than time-series length, and that calibrating on dry conditions might be a robust choice when aiming at predicting arbitrary future conditions (wet, dry or mixed). Furthermore, we found that posterior parameter estimates converged to a common optimum range with increasing data size under all investigated calibration scenarios, indicating that compensation of model structural errors by parameter fitting is independent of the chosen calibration condition. However, calibrating on time-series 8\,years or longer led to overconfident predictions that failed to reliably envelope future data. While these findings are specific to our case study, we recommend using the CDSST to stress-test conceptual hydrological models to identify robust model parameters and/or deficiencies in the model structure. In general, we expect our proposed approach to be a valuable basis for model error diagnosis in any type of dynamic environmental system model, because it answers the following three questions: (1) what is the importance of physical processes not explicitly covered by the model? (2) How much overconfidence is present in the model? And (3), what are case-specific recommendations for appropriate calibration and validation setups?},

  abstract = {SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a conceptual, continuous time model that was developed in the early 1990s to assist water resource managers in assessing the impact of management and climate on water supplies and non-point source pollution in watersheds and large river basins. SWAT is the continuation of over 30 years of model development within the US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service and was developed to `scale up' past field-scale models to large river basins. Model components include weather, hydrology, erosion/sedimentation, plant growth, nutrients, pesticides, agricultural management, stream routing and pond/reservoir routing. The latest version, SWAT2000, has several significant enhancements that include: bacteria transport routines; urban routines; Green and Ampt infiltration equation; improved weather generator; ability to read in daily solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed and potential ET; Muskingum channel routing; and modified dormancy calculations for tropical areas. A complete set of model documentation for equations and algorithms, a user manual describing model inputs and outputs, and an ArcView interface manual are now complete for SWAT2000. The model has been recoded into Fortran 90 with a complete data dictionary, dynamic allocation of arrays and modular subroutines. Current research is focusing on bacteria, riparian zones, pothole topography, forest growth, channel downcutting and widening, and input uncertainty analysis. The model SWAT is meanwhile used in many countries all over the world. Recent developments in European Environmental Policy, such as the adoption of the European Water Framework directive in December 2000, demand tools for integrative river basin management. The model SWAT is applicable for this purpose. It is a flexible model that can be used under a wide range of different environmental conditions, as this special issue will show. The papers compiled here are the result of the first International SWAT Conference held in August 2001 in Rauischholzhausen, Germany. More than 50 participants from 14 countries discussed their modelling experiences with the model development team from the USA. Nineteen selected papers with issues reaching from the newest developments, the evaluation of river basin management, interdisciplinary approaches for river basin management, the impact of land use change, methodical aspects and models derived from SWAT are published in this special issue.

We propose a general testing framework, in which we perform series of split-sample tests, testing all possible combinations of calibration-validation periods using a 10 year sliding window. This methodology, which we have called the generalized split-sample test (GSST), provides insights into the model's transposability over time under various climatic conditions. The three conceptual rainfall-runoff models yielded similar results over a set of 216 catchments in southeast Australia. First, we assessed the model's efficiency in validation using a criterion combining the root-mean-square error and bias. A relation was found between this efficiency and the changes in mean rainfall (P) but not with changes in mean potential evapotranspiration (PE) or air temperature (T). Second, we focused on average runoff volumes and found that simulation biases are greatly affected by changes in P. Calibration over a wetter (drier) climate than the validation climate leads to an overestimation (underestimation) of the mean simulated runoff. We observed different magnitudes of these models deficiencies depending on the catchment considered. Results indicate that the transfer of model parameters in time may introduce a significant level of errors in simulations, meaning increased uncertainty in the various practical applications of these models (flow simulation, forecasting, design, reservoir management, climate change impact assessments, etc.). Testing model robustness with respect to this issue should help better quantify these uncertainties.},

The measure of the quality of performance is the degree of agreement of the simulation result with observation. Hence, the power of the tests being proposed is rather modest, and even a fully successful result can be seen only as a necessary, rather than a sufficient, condition for model adequacy vis-{\`a}-vis the specific modelling objective. The scheme contains no new and original ideas; it is merely an attempt to present an organized methodology based on standard techniques, a methodology that can be viewed as a generalization of the routine split-sample test.

In this study, laboratory model tests were carried out to examine the characteristics of rainfall infiltration, deformation, and failures of slopes in the red-bed area of Sichuan. The hydrological response and deformation of the slope soil during rainfall are addressed. Based on a modified Green--Ampt infiltration model, ponding along the bedrock surface is incorporated. A physically based model for shallow landslides caused by rainfall is developed. The theoretical analysis and the model test results indicate that the slope failures are related to erosion in the shallow soil layer and rainwater infiltration, particularly along preferential seepage channels. The process of rainfall-induced shallow landslides can be separated into three stages: erosion at the slope toe, tension crack formation at the slope crest, and shallow sliding. When initial underground water level is located at the bedrock surface or the preferential seepage flow quickly reaches the bedrock surface, it is easier for the soil slopes to slide along the bedrock surface than along the wetting front.},

Such uncertainty is often considered to be negligible with respect to other approximations affecting hydrological studies. Actually, given that river discharge data are usually obtained by means of the so-called rating curve method, a number of different sources of error affect the derived observations. These include: errors in measurements of river stage and discharge utilised to parameterise the rating curve, interpolation and extrapolation error of the rating curve, presence of unsteady flow conditions, and seasonal variations of the state of the vegetation (i.e. roughness). This study aims at analysing these sources of uncertainty using an original methodology. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in the estimation of rating curve uncertainty, which is based on hydraulic simulations. These latter are carried out on a reach of the Po River (Italy) by means of a one-dimensional (1-D) hydraulic model code (HEC-RAS). The results of the study show that errors in river flow data are indeed far from negligible.},

  abstract = {Meaningful quantification of data and structural uncertainties in conceptual rainfall-runoff modeling is a major scientific and engineering challenge. This paper focuses on the total predictive uncertainty and its decomposition into input and structural components under different inference scenarios. Several Bayesian inference schemes are investigated, differing in the treatment of rainfall and structural uncertainties, and in the precision of the priors describing rainfall uncertainty. Compared with traditional lumped additive error approaches, the quantification of the total predictive uncertainty in the runoff is improved when rainfall and/or structural errors are characterized explicitly. However, the decomposition of the total uncertainty into individual sources is more challenging. In particular, poor identifiability may arise when the inference scheme represents rainfall and structural errors using separate probabilistic models. The inference becomes ill-posed unless sufficiently precise prior knowledge of data uncertainty is supplied; this ill-posedness can often be detected from the behavior of the Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Moreover, the priors on the data quality must also be sufficiently accurate if the inference is to be reliable and support meaningful uncertainty decomposition. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of inferring inaccurate hydrologic models using rainfall-runoff data with large unknown errors. Bayesian total error analysis can overcome these problems using independent prior information. The need for deriving independent descriptions of the uncertainties in the input and output data is clearly demonstrated.},

First, Penman PE estimates were regionalized in the Massif Central highlands of France, a mountainous area where PE is known to vary greatly with elevation, latitude, and longitude. The two watershed models were then used to assess changes in model efficiency with the improved PE input. Finally, the behavior of one of the model's parameters was analyzed, to understand how watershed models cope with systematic errors in the estimated PE input. In terms of model efficiency, in both models it was found that very simple assumptions on watershed PE input (the same average input for all watersheds) yield the same results as more accurate input obtained from regionalization. The detailed evaluation of the GR4J model calibrated with different PE input scenarios showed that the model is clearly sensitive to PE input, but that it uses its two production parameters to adapt to the various PE scenarios.},

A dynamic sensitivity analysis approach was adopted (i.e. with re-calibration of model parameters). Results indicate that watershed models use their different functions (and corresponding parameters) to absorb input errors and muffle their impact on streamflow simulations. The main conclusions are: (1) models are almost insensitive to random errors in PE series, which comes from the inherent low pass filter properties of rainfall-runoff models; (2) random errors in rainfall series significantly affect model performances and parameter values; (3) systematic errors in PE series have a greater impact than random errors, but they are partly buffered by Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) stores; (4) systematic errors in rainfall time series, when large enough, can be very detrimental to model performances but their impact can be reduced if the model structure includes a procedure other than evapotranspiration to adapt water balance.}

With increasing capacity of computational power several complex optimization algorithms have emerged, but none of the algorithms gives a unique and very best parameter vector. The parameters of fitted hydrological models depend upon the input data. The quality of input data cannot be assured as there may be measurement errors for both input and state variables. In this study a methodology has been developed to find a set of robust parameter vectors for a hydrological model. To see the effect of observational error on parameters, stochastically generated synthetic measurement errors were applied to observed discharge and temperature data. With this modified data, the model was calibrated and the effect of measurement errors on parameters was analysed. It was found that the measurement errors have a significant effect on the best performing parameter vector. The erroneous data led to very different optimal parameter vectors. To overcome this problem and to find a set of robust parameter vectors, a geometrical approach based on Tukey's half space depth was used. The depth of the set of N randomly generated parameters was calculated with respect to the set with the best model performance (Nash-Sutclife efficiency was used for this study) for each parameter vector. Based on the depth of parameter vectors, one can find a set of robust parameter vectors. The results show that the parameters chosen according to the above criteria have low sensitivity and perform well when transfered to a different time period. The method is demonstrated on the upper Neckar catchment in Germany. The conceptual HBV model was used for this study.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Global urban expansion has altered surface aerodynamics and hydrothermal dynamics, aggravating environmental challenges such as urban heat/dry islands. To identify such environmental responses, various physical models, including urban canyon models (UCMs) and land surface models (LSMs), have been developed to represent surface hydrothermal processes. However, UCMs often treat a city as a unified entity and overlook subcity heterogeneity. LSMs are generally designed for natural land covers and lack the capability to capture urban characteristics. To address these limitations, the aim of this study is to couple an urban module with a sophisticated LSM, i.e., the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. This coupled model, i.e., the VIC-urban model, is characterized by its ability to coordinate certain critical urban features, including the urban geometry, radiative interactions, and human impacts. Adopting Beijing as an evaluation site, the VIC-urban model shows higher performance than the original version, with excellent accuracy in simulating sensible heat, latent heat, runoff, and land surface temperature (LST). The absolute error is smaller than 25 \% for the sensible heat and latent heat, and smaller than 12 \% and 30 \% for the LST and runoff, respectively, which indicates that VIC-urban can effectively simulate hydrological and thermal fluxes in urban systems. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the roof emissivity and interception capacity exert the greatest impact on the roof temperature and evaporation, and the height-width ratio exerts the greatest influence on the canyon. Our work introduces a reliable option for large-scale land surface simulations that accounts for urban environments, and is among the first attempts to establish a systematic urban modelling framework of the VIC model. The VIC-urban model enables the analysis of urbanization-induced environmental changes and quantification of environmental variations among different urban configurations. The proposed model can thus offer invaluable insights for urban planners and landscape designers.},

  abstract = {With the help of relatively few conservative crop parameters, AquaCrop simulates final crop yield in four steps that are easy to understand, which makes the modeling approach transparent. The steps consist in the simulation of development of the green crop canopy cover, crop transpiration, above-ground biomass, and final crop yield. Temperature and water stresses directly affect one or more of the above processes. Nutrient deficiencies and salinity effects are simulated indirectly by moderating canopy cover development over the season, and by reducing crop transpiration and the normalized water productivity. The effect of CO2 concentration on biomass is simulated by altering the normalized water productivity. The model requires a relatively small number of explicit parameter values and mostly intuitive input variables. The paper describes the essence of AquaCrop Version 4.0, applications and parameterization of crops, crop responses to elevated CO2 concentration, soil fertility and salinity, and further model developments.},

  abstract = {Climate change and extreme weather events (such as droughts, heatwaves, rainstorms and floods) pose serious challenges for water management, in terms of both~water resources availability and water quality. However, the responses and mechanisms of river water quality under more frequent and intense hydroclimatic extremes are not well understood. In this Review, we assess the impacts of hydroclimatic extremes and multidecadal climate change on a wide range of water quality constituents to identify the key responses and driving mechanisms. Comparison of 965 case studies indicates that river water quality generally deteriorates under droughts and heatwaves (68\% of compiled cases), rainstorms and floods (51\%) and under long-term climate change (56\%). Also improvements or mixed responses are reported owing to counteracting mechanisms, for example, increased pollutant mobilization versus dilution during flood events. River water quality responses under multidecadal climate change are driven by hydrological alterations, rises in water and soil temperatures and interactions among hydroclimatic, land use and human drivers. These complex interactions synergistically influence the sources, transport and transformation of all water quality constituents. Future research must target tools, techniques and models that support the design of robust water quality management strategies, in a world that is facing more frequent and severe hydroclimatic extremes.},

  abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment (FIFE) intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

Therefore, non-structural measures are necessary to prepare and respond to the damage caused by drought in a flexible manner according to the stage of drought. In this study, an AI-based water demand prediction model was developed using deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. The model was trained from 2004 to 2015 and verified from 2016 to 2021. Model accuracy was evaluated using data, with the LSTM model achieving a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.95 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 8.38, indicating excellent performance. The probability of the random variable X falling within the interval [a,b], as described by the probability density function f(x), was calculated using the water demand data. The cumulative distribution function was used to calculate the probability of the random variable being less than or equal to a specific value. These calculations were used to establish the criteria for each stage of the crisis alert system. Decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) models, based on AI-based classification, were used to predict water demand at the Gurye intake station. The models took into account the impact of water demand from the previous day, as well as the effects of rainfall, maximum temperature, and average temperature. Daily water demand data from the Gurye intake station and the previous day's rainfall, maximum temperature, and average temperature data from a nearby observatory were collected from 2004 to 2021. The models were trained on data from 2004 to 2015 and validated on data from 2016 to 2021. Model accuracy was evaluated using the F1-score, with the random forest model achieving a score of 0.88, indicating excellent performance.},

A global water assessment model called ``WaterGAP 2'' is described, which consists of two main components'a Global Water Use model and a Global Hydrology model. These components are used to compute water use and availability on the river basin level. The Global Water Use model consists of (a) domestic and industry sectors which take into account the effect of structural and technological changes on water use, and (b) an agriculture sector which accounts especially for the effect of climate on irrigation water requirements. The Global Hydrology model calculates surface runoff and groundwater recharge based on the computation of daily water balances of the soil and canopy. A water balance is also performed for surface waters, and river flow is routed via a global flow routing scheme. The Global Hydrology model provides a testable method for taking into account the effects of climate and land cover on runoff. The components of the model have been calibrated and tested against data on water use and runoff from river basins throughout the world. Although its performance can and needs to be improved, the WaterGAP 2 model already provides a consistent method to fill in many of the existing gaps in water resources data in many parts of the world. It also provides a coherent approach for generating scenarios of changes in water resources. Hence, it is especially useful as a tool for globally comparing the water situation in river basins.},

  abstract = {Groundwater depletion (GWD) compromises crop production in major global agricultural areas and has negative ecological consequences. To derive GWD at the grid cell, country, and global levels, we applied a new version of the global hydrological model WaterGAP that simulates not only net groundwater abstractions and groundwater recharge from soils but also groundwater recharge from surface water bodies in dry regions. A large number of independent estimates of GWD as well as total water storage (TWS) trends determined from GRACE satellite data by three analysis centers were compared to model results. GWD and TWS trends are simulated best assuming that farmers in GWD areas irrigate at 70\% of optimal water requirement. India, United States, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and China had the highest GWD rates in the first decade of the 21st century. On the Arabian Peninsula, in Libya, Egypt, Mali, Mozambique, and Mongolia, at least 30\% of the abstracted groundwater was taken from nonrenewable groundwater during this time period. The rate of global GWD has likely more than doubled since the period 1960--2000. Estimated GWD of 113 km3/yr during 2000--2009, corresponding to a sea level rise of 0.31 mm/yr, is much smaller than most previous estimates. About 15\% of the globally abstracted groundwater was taken from nonrenewable groundwater during this period. To monitor recent temporal dynamics of GWD and related water abstractions, GRACE data are best evaluated with a hydrological model that, like WaterGAP, simulates the impact of abstractions on water storage, but the low spatial resolution of GRACE remains a challenge.},

  abstract = {The importance of efficient water resource supply has been acknowledged, and it is essential to predict short-term water consumption in the future. Recently, it has become possible to obtain data on water consumption at the household level through smart water meters. The pattern of these data is nonlinear due to various factors related to human activities, such as holidays and weather. However, it is difficult to accurately predict household water consumption with a nonlinear pattern with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a traditional time series prediction model. Thus, this study used a deep learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) approach to develop a water consumption prediction model for each customer. The proposed model considers several variables to learn nonlinear water consumption patterns. We developed an ARIMA model and an LSTM model in the training dataset for customers with four different water-use types (detached houses, apartment, restaurant, and elementary school). The performances of the two models were evaluated using a test dataset that was not used for model learning. The LSTM model outperformed the ARIMA model in all households (correlation coefficient: mean 89\% and root mean square error: mean 5.60 m3). Therefore, it is expected that the proposed model can predict customer-specific water consumption at the household level depending on the type of use.},

Three dimensionless variables control the modeled system: one to indicate the temperature regime, one for the seasonality of both temperature and precipitation, and one for the mean precipitation rate relative to a characteristic melt rate. The purpose of the model is to provide insight into the relative roles of the mean and seasonality of temperature, the mean and seasonality of precipitation, and the melt factor, in controlling snow climatology. The model can be used to make broad-scale predictions of the climatology of seasonal snow water storage, and its sensitivity to climate. Particular variables of interest include the maximum seasonal snow storage, the start and end of the snow accumulation period, and the time of year at which the snowpack is completely melted. The model makes useful uncalibrated predictions at six widely separated sites in the western USA which have a continuous seasonal snowpack. The connections between the model and a widely-used snow classification of Sturm et al. are briefly explored. Limitations of the model are discussed, extensions to the model are foreshadowed, and an example is given of a global application. If further testing demonstrates that the model gives adequate estimates of seasonal snowpack response for a wider range of locations, we might envisage applications of this approach to (i) definition of hydrological similarity indices in snow-dominated regions (ii) interpretation of output from complex simulation models covering a wide range of environments (iii) screening-level analyses of sensitivity to climate variations (iv) low-dimensional modeling where there are limited data or computation resources or technical expertise.},

The evapotranspiration component is represented by a model of three soil layers. Runoff production occurs on repletion of storage to capacity values which are assumed to be distributed throughout the basin. Prior to 1980, runoff was separated into surface and groundwater components using Horton's concept of infiltration. Subsequently, the concept of hillslope hydrology was introduced with an additional component, interflow, being identified. Runoff concentration to the outflow of each sub-basin is represented by a unit hydrograph or by a lag and route technique. The damping or routing effects of the channel system connecting the sub-basins are represented by Muskingum routing. There are fifteen parameters in all, of which the model is particularly sensitive to six. Optimization of the parameters is achieved with different objective functions according to the nature of each parameter. The model has been widely used in China since 1980, mainly for flood forecasting, though more recently it is also being used for other purposes.},

  abstract = {The ability of water balance models to incorporate month--month or seasonal variations in climate, snowfall and snowmelt, groundwater fluctuations, soil moisture characteristics, and natural climatic variability makes them especially attractive for water resources studies of climatic changes. The use of conceptual models to explore the impact of climate changes has increased in recent years. Because of the success claimed for these studies, it is likely that computer simulation of catchments will increasingly be used by and for water resource managers as an aid to decision-making. There is therefore a need for a generally accepted method for demonstrating a model's fitness for such use. The simple split-sample test method may be reasonable in the simplest case of the `filling-in missing data' problem but certainly not if the express purpose of the model is to simulate records for conditions different from those corresponding to the calibration record, such as the problem with predicting the effects of climate changes where the data on the changed system are not (and cannot be) available for comparison with the model predictions. Thus, model validation must demonstrate `fitness for the said purpose'. In this paper, available model validation methods are reviewed and the hierarchical scheme for systematic testing of hydrological simulation models according to the modelling tasks, proposed by Klemes (1986) (Klemes, V., 1986. Hydrol. Sci. J. 31, 13--24) is discussed in detail and exemplified using the NOPEX water balance model (Xu, C.-Y., Seibert, J., Halldin, S., 1996. J. Hydrol. 180, 211--236) and NOPEX data.},

  abstract = {Approaches to modeling the continuous hydrologic response of ungauged basins use observable physical characteristics of watersheds to either directly infer values for the parameters of hydrologic models, or to establish regression relationships between watershed structure and model parameters. Both these approaches still have widely discussed limitations, including impacts of model structural uncertainty. In this paper we introduce an alternative, model independent, approach to streamflow prediction in ungauged basins based on empirical evidence of relationships between watershed structure, climate and watershed response behavior. Instead of directly estimating values for model parameters, different hydrologic response behaviors of the watershed, quantified through model independent streamflow indices, are estimated and subsequently regionalized in an uncertainty framework. This results in expected ranges of streamflow indices in ungauged watersheds. A pilot study using 30 UK watersheds shows how this regionalized information can be used to constrain ensemble predictions of any model at ungauged sites. Dominant controlling characteristics were found to be climate (wetness index), watershed topography (slope), and hydrogeology. Main streamflow indices were high pulse count, runoff ratio, and the slope of the flow duration curve. This new approach provided sharp and reliable predictions of continuous streamflow at the ungauged sites tested.},
